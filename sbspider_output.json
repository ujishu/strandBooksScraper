Book designer Peter Mendelsund is the author of <em>What We See When We Read</em> and <em>Cover</em>, a monograph about his design process. Abbott Miller is a partner at Pentagram and author of <em>Abbott Miller: Design and Content</em>, published by Princeton Architectural Press.

Her first novel, <em>Four Aleys</em>, traces the lives of four Syrian Christian women over the first half of the twentieth century in an India changing from the old feudal ways to the new. Early last year, Renu and the students of her Creative Writing class at St Xavier\u2019s Institute of Communication, Bombay, brought out a collection of their short stories, Potluck, A Literary Collection of the Critique Group, which was well received in India. She is active in women\u2019s empowerment programs in her neighborhood in Bombay, where she lives. She is at work on her second novel.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis book tells the story of four women \u2013 all named Aley - connected by blood, marriage and love. The story is told mainly through the bewildered eyes of the youngest one who tries to unravel and make sense of the doings around herin the behemoth of a home they all inhabit: Big House. The story unravels against the setting of a feudal society where the bonded strain against the chains of loyalty, dependence and fear to finally free themselves from their masters who themselves, as a result of decadent living, are victims of self-destructive tumultuous passions. It is a story of human bondage, endurance and loyalty and obsession. And through it a child searches for answers to hidden secrets and herself.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAdmission to this event is free and open to the public.\r\n</p>\r\n</div>",

Kate Darling's enigmatic mother--a once-famous ballerina--has passed away, leaving Kate bereft.

The stakes are high: Restoring the political and economic power of today\u2019s working class, Draut argues, is the best path to securing all of our economic futures.

	"description": "<div class=\"event__description\"><p>\r\n\tThis incredible panel of heavy-hitting designers will discuss the invention of desire in design. Today, books on \u201cdesign thinking\u201d are best sellers, and computer and Web-based tools have expanded the definition of who practices design. Looking at objects, letterforms, experiences, and even theatrical performances, award-winning author Jessica Helfand asserts that understanding design's purpose is more crucial than ever. Design is meaningful not because it is pretty but because it is an intrinsically humanist discipline, tethered to the very core of why we exist. Advancing a conversation that is unfolding around the globe, Helfand offers an eye-opening look at how designed things make us feel as well as how\u2014and why\u2014they motivate our behavior.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPanelists include:\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Jessica Helfand</strong>\u00a0is a designer, writer, and educator. She has written for numerous national publications, and is the author of several books on visual and cultural criticism including <em>Screen: Essays on Graphic Design, New Media and Visual Culture</em> (2001), <em>Reinventing the Wheel</em> (2002) and the critically acclaimed <em>Scrapbooks: An American History</em>. A co-founder of <em>Design Observer</em> where, with Michael Bierut, she hosts the podcast <a href=\"http://designobserver.com/topic/theobservatory/1045\">The Observatory</a>, Helfand is a Senior Critic in Graphic Design at the Yale School of Art, a Lecturer in Yale College, and a faculty affiliate in the History of Science. In 2015, she was appointed Artist in Residence at the Yale Institute for Network Science. Named the first Henry Wolf Resident in Design at the American Academy in Rome in 2010, Jessica Helfand is a member of the Alliance Graphique Internationale and the Art Director\u2019s Hall of Fame. She won the AIGA medal, the design profession\u2019s highest honor, in 2013.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Paula Scher</strong> has been at the forefront of graphic design for more than three decades. Iconic, smart and unabashedly populist, her images have entered into the American vernacular. Scher has been a principal in the New York office of the distinguished international design consultancy Pentagram since 1991. She began her career as an art director in the 1970s and early '80s, when her eclectic approach to typography became highly influential. In the mid-1990s her landmark identity for The Public Theater fused high and low into a wholly new symbology for cultural institutions, and her recent architectural collaborations have re-imagined the urban landscape as a dynamic environment of dimensional graphic design.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Eugenia Bell</strong> is Executive Editor at <em>Design Observer</em>. She was the design editor of <em>frieze </em>magazine from 2007\u20132013, and is a longtime editor of books on art, architecture, and graphic design. Her writing has appeared in <em>frieze</em>, <em>Bookforum</em>, <em>Artforum</em>, <em>New York</em> magazine, and on <em>Design Observer</em>.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Julie Lasky</strong> is a journalist, editor and critic best known for her writings on design and popular culture. She is a frequent contributor to the New York <em>Times</em>, <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, <em>Travel &amp; Leisure</em>, and many other publications. From 2012 to 2015, she was the deputy editor of the New York <em>Times</em>\u2019s weekly Home section, for which she wrote a monthly column on new design called \u201cThe Details.\u201d A widely published writer, she is the author of the books <em>Irving Harper: Works in Paper</em> (Skira/Rizzoli); <em>Some People Can't Surf: The Graphic Design of Art Chantry </em>(Chronicle Books) and <em>Bespoke: The Handbuilt Bicycle</em> (Lars M\u00fcller). She co-authored, with Steven Heller, <em>Borrowed Design: Use and Abuse of Historical Form</em> (Wiley). She has taught in MFA programs at the School of Visual Arts and Rhode Island School of Design. She is a frequent speaker at international forums on subjects from voting machines to vintage paperbacks.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>V\u00e9ronique Vienne</strong> was a magazine art director in the USA when she began to write to better analyze and understand the work of the graphic designers, illustrators and photographers who collaborated with her. Today she writes books and conducts workshops on design criticism as a creative tool.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"wysiwyg-float-left\" height=\"44\" width=\"44\"><img align=\"left\" alt=\"\" height=\"44\" hspace=\"5\" src=\"/resources/strand/images/uploads/admit-one-icon-44px.jpg\" style=\"line-height: 19.2px;\" vspace=\"3\" width=\"44\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6;\">Buy a copy of <em>The Invention of Desire</em> or a $20 gift card in-store at Strand's main floor registers or at the door to attend.

In this class, we will look closely at women like Zelda Fitzgerald and Sylvia Plath, deconstructing their actual lived experiences and how that may have contributed to their perceived madness. We will also-- of course-- discuss their husbands F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ted Hughes and how these men factored into the mythologized stories of their respective wives.

Powerful personal connections link the works that grew from near-daily contact with other geniuses. What has been obscured by the halo of their success is that many were audaciously trying media with which they had little experience. Writers and composers painted up a storm, artists turned into poets, and the theater gathered dream teams of talent. Hemingway was a connoisseur of contemporary art, Gershwin and cummings exhibited paintings, Leger made films, Pound wrote an opera, and Picasso was spending more time backstage at the Ballets Russes than in the studio. This is a celebration of the courage to go beyond one\u2019s specialty to experiment.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<img align=\"left\" alt=\"\" height=\"44\" hspace=\"5\" src=\"/resources/strand/images/uploads/admit-one-icon-44px.jpg\" style=\"line-height: 19.2px;\" vspace=\"3\" width=\"44\">\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBuy a $20 ticket in-store at Strand to attend this event-- admission will include 1\u00a0<span style=\"line-height: 19.2px;\">drink</span>.

As both subjects and creators of these images, Drucker and Ernst, both of whom transitioned gender, represent themselves in the midst of shifting subjectivities and identities. Collectively, these photographs, which have been compared to the work of Larry Clark, Nan Goldin, and Cindy Sherman, document the story of their romantic and creative collaboration over a period of six years. Simultaneously narrative and documentary, they touch on a host of dynamics, offering autobiography as ambiguity and unraveling identity as a construction.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMale becomes female. Female becomes male. Life becomes art. Private becomes public. A major feature of the 2014 Whitney Biennial, this series of photographs that the New York Times called \"extremely provocative\" explores ideas of transformation both physical and psychological.

Both profound and funny, the Readers Theater will combine big idea fiction with the power of science to stand up for human rights in the struggle for the future that is taking place all over the world.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Readers Theater will include literature, magical, quixotic and liberatory, sane and inane, world affairs, how we live and how we die, how we educate our children, how our political masters frame our lives, how we rebel and create our own frames, how we struggle for the future, struggle with existential risks that in past generations didn\u2019t exist \u2013 or if they did we did not know about them.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe hope you will join us to cheer Garn authors on and then participate in the conversation with them that will follow about the sheer joyfulness of reading books and the angst we all feel as we make connections between these uncertain times and the books we read.

Buffy the Vampire Slayer wrestled with understanding not only her place in the world as a superhero, but also finding her place as young woman tasked with such a role. Should her power be rooted in something different than our traditional masculine notions of strength? Or is power simply power\u2014void of gender and value? In this Olio, we will examine Joss Whedon\u2019s creation, Buffy, and analyze the significance of the slayer\u2019s struggle to fight evil while remaining \u201cjust a girl.\u201d\u00a0\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThrough discussion and the viewing of a few clips, we will look critically at the show\u2019s overarching narrative, asking ourselves: Was Buffy truly a feminist icon? If so, what kind of feminist? Radical? Liberal? Marxist? What does it mean that she alone held power that others had no access to? That she used violence to solve problems? That in the eye of the struggle, she often found herself alone, having more in common with the evil she was fighting than with the good she was trying to protect. Why, for example, was she so hot for vampires? We will discuss and debate whether, in the end, Buffy reconciled these dilemmas as she saved the world. (Again!) Finally, we will ask ourselves what lessons we can learn from the slayer as we navigate modern patriarchy and capitalism.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis class will be taught by Jamie Warren, Assistant Professor of American history, the history of women and gender, and women\u2019s studies at BMCC-CUNY and holder of a Ph.D. in American History from Indiana University. Her research focuses on slavery in antebellum South with a particular focus on death, the body, and the philosophy of history.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<img align=\"left\" alt=\"\" height=\"44\" hspace=\"5\" src=\"/resources/strand/images/uploads/admit-one-icon-44px.jpg\" style=\"line-height: 19.2px;\" vspace=\"3\" width=\"44\"><a href=\"http://classes.thinkolio.org/olios/What-Would-Buffy-Do/\">Buy a $20 ticket to attend this event</a>-- admission will include 1\u00a0<span style=\"line-height: 19.2px;\">drink, courtesy of\u00a0</span><a href=\"http://www.jennyandfrancois.com\" style=\"line-height: 19.2px;\">Jenny &amp; Francois</a>.

However, it was her efforts on behalf of Ellen Johnson Sirleaf that form the heart of <em>Choosing the Hero</em>. Riva describes how she met the then-exiled Sirleaf, who was determined to return to Liberia and run for the presidency against the warlord Charles Taylor. Riva chronicles her behind-the-scenes lobbying for Sirleaf in Washington, D.C., as well as her on-the-ground efforts supporting the presidential campaign in Liberia.

	"description": "<div class=\"event__description\"><p>\r\n\tIn his groundbreaking study, <em>The History of Sexuality: Volume 1</em>, philosopher and historian Michel Foucault provocatively argued that the thing we call sexuality, the supposed essence of our sexual core, our desires, our selves, is in fact \u201ca name that can be given to a historical construct.\u201d In this Olio, we will discuss the significance of Foucault\u2019s claim that sexuality is not an essential and fixed quality inherent to our being, but rather the result of historical shifts in power and knowledge. We will examine how and why it is we have come to think of sexuality as a \u201cproblem of truth,\u201d as a secret to be revealed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe will look closely at the philosopher\u2019s controversial claim that at the very moment we imagine sexuality as being repressed, driven under, made to hide, it was indeed \u201cexploding,\u201d \u201cinciting,\u201d and proliferating unto every aspect of human experience. We will also ask ourselves about the value of Foucault\u2019s work for challenging our own ideas about our personal desires, our identity categories, and our cherished notions of the self.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJamie Warren has a Ph.D. in American History from Indiana University, and she is an Assistant Professor at BMCC-CUNY where she teaches American history, the history of women and gender, and women\u2019s studies.

At the height of his career, a fixture in the rap game for more than a decade, Lil Wayne (aka Weezy) had established himself as both a prolific musician and a savvy businessman, smashing long-held industry records, winning multiple Grammy Awards, and signing up-and-coming talent like Drake and Nicki Minaj to his Young Money label. All of this momentum came to a halt when he was convicted of possession of a firearm and sentenced to a yearlong stay at Rikers Island. Suddenly, the artist at the top of his game was now an inmate at the mercy of the American penal system. At long last, <em>Gone \u2019Til November </em>reveals the true story of what really happened while Wayne was behind bars, exploring everything from his daily rituals to his interactions with other inmates to how he was able to keep himself motivated and grateful. Taken directly from Wayne\u2019s own journal, this intimate, personal account of his incarceration is an utterly humane look at the man behind the artist.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Please note: </strong>This event is a signing for <em>Gone \u2018Til November </em>only. It will take place on the Strand\u2019s main floor. The line will begin forming at 12:00 PM in front of the store on Broadway. Lil Wayne will sign (<strong>NO personalizations</strong> and <strong>NO records or memorabilia</strong>) <strong>one book</strong> per customer. Photos are permitted from the line, but <strong>posed photos with Lil Wayne are NOT permitted</strong>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIf you order a book, you will be checked in while in line, and receive your book at the end to have it signed. Please note that signed copies will be available while supplies last, and ONLY for the duration of the event. If you have any questions regarding the status of your order, please call the Strand customer service department at (212) 473-1452 x420.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<img align=\"left\" alt=\"\" height=\"44\" hspace=\"5\" src=\"/resources/strand/images/uploads/admit-one-icon-44px.jpg\" style=\"line-height: 19.2px;\" vspace=\"3\" width=\"44\">\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 12px;\">\r\n\tBuy a copy of <em>Gone Til November</em> at Strand's main floor registers to attend.\u00a0Please note that payment is required before getting in line.

Fewer than 1,000 copies were published. Today, very few copies exist that are available for public viewing. Its formal title is <em>Depero Futurista</em> -- which means Depero the Futurist. But it is popularly known as <em>The Bolted Book </em>because it is bound together by two large industrial aluminum bolts. Unbolted, the book can be disassembled and its pages displayed individually.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOn Monday, November 14, you will be able to see a copy of this remarkable example of avant-garde bookmaking at a \u201cshow and tell\u201d on the second-floor art and design section at the Strand bookstore. If you can\u2019t make it to the Strand you\u2019ll be able to watch live on Kickstarter Live.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe featured speakers will be Laura Mattioli, founder and president of the Center for Italian Modern Art; and Steven Heller, co-founder and co-chair, the School of Visual Arts Design/Designer as Author + Entrepreneur program. Laura will talk about the relationship between Depero and her father, who was one of Depero\u2019s principal patrons. Steven will describe Depero\u2019s place in the history of graphic design and bookmaking.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThen with a copy of the original book from 1927 owned by Laura, Laura and Steven will give a tour through the book -- highlighting key pages and providing insights and commentary on its groundbreaking ideas, pyrotechnic typography, and innovative graphic design.

Did you catch him in Fall Out Boy\u2019s latest music video? Doug can ball with the best of them. He\u2019s a rising star and everyone\u2019s favorite squishy face. Doug has made appearances at music festivals including Lollapalooza and the Billboard Hot 100 Music Fest, but he doesn\u2019t let fame go to his head.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDoug is a humble pug, but the people have asked for more, so he\u2019s obliged with <em>King of Pop Culture, </em>his\u00a0awesome collection of photos.

It\u2019s what Kurt Vonnegut, James Baldwin, and Virginia Woolf would play if they were alive, locked in a room together, and forced to play a card game. The rules of Papercuts are similar to Cards Against Humanity\u2122, and it can be played on its own or as a bookish expansion pack.

It takes only 20 minutes to play, but when you finish, you'll want to play it again. That's because Wordsy is unlike most other word games. In Wordsy, you get 8 letters dealt out on the table. All players simultaneously try to come up with the best word on the board. Here's the thing: you don't need all the letters in your word to be on the board. You can add as many letters as you want! So you're never just one letter away, like in most word games. This means Wordsy rewards longer words. Those 2- and 3-letter words you have to memorize for other word games won't help you here!</li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/827765657/moby-dick-or-the-card-game\">Moby-Dick, or, the Card Game by King Post</a>: A dynamic and action-packed card game for 2-4 players, lovingly adapted from Herman Melville\u2019s classic novel.

Assemble your crew, hunt whales and try to survive the final chase for the White Whale!</li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/827765657/beowulf-a-board-game\">Beowulf by King Post</a>: a dynamic tabletop strategy game for 3-6 players, adapted from one of the oldest and most celebrated works of European literature. The game uses the Anglo-Saxon epic poem as a point of entry into a vast interpretation of the Viking Age. As the legend of Beowulf's life and death unfolds on the game's board, players will trade, scheme and raid one another to grow their own kingdom's influence and power. After the death of Beowulf at the fangs of a dragon, the game moves forward in time, as players scramble to preserve the brave legacies of their kingdoms in the face of a quickly changing religious landscape and the relentless tides of history.</li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2093152267/the-metagame-discuss\">Metagame by L</a><a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2093152267/the-metagame-discuss\">ocal No. 12:</a> A party game about sharing opinions on the most important debates of our time, like \"which feels more like first love: The Mona Lisa or the Big Mac?\" The Metagame includes culture cards that feature media, art, fashion and entertainment, and opinion cards that prompt lively chatter and lots of laughter. The Metagame is more than one game\u2014it includes six unique games. Some of the games get you talking. Others are about thinking fast. Some games are strategic and others are just plain silly. Including 200 culture cards and 100 opinion cards, The Metagame scales from two to 50 players. Play it at a dinner party or a family gathering, at a bar or at school, or anywhere that humans gather.</li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.bringyourownbook.com/\">Bring Your Own Book by Do Better Games:</a> The game of borrowed phrases, where players search through books for text to take way out of context. It's easy. Players take turns drawing prompts from the deck, then race to find the best phrase in their own book that satisfies the prompt. Since you can use a different book each time, you can play it with any audience, and there's a practically infinite supply of source material.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>",

	"description": "<div class=\"event__description\"><p>\r\n\tFrom eSports events drawing thousands of spectators to Candy Crush players killing time on the subway, the world of gaming has expanded drastically in recent years. Of course, as with any other mainstream form of entertainment, video games have become the spotlight of several criticisms as politicians, media, and parents wonder about the effects they have on those who play. After years of research, it turns out video games have a lot of good to offer, besides hours of fun.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGames for Change chairman Asi Burak and journalist Laura Parker decided to explore how video games pioneer social change, how the stories games feature can focus on social and political issues in an immersive way that other art forms can\u2019t capture. They have worked with NASA, World Bank, the White House, and The United Nations in order to promote the positive effects of gaming.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJoin us in the Rare Book Room as Asi Burak talks with Susanna Pollack, President of Games for Change, about how video games can change the future. After the discussion, both Asi Burak and Laura Parker will sign copies of their book.\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 12px;\">\r\n\t<img align=\"left\" alt=\"\" height=\"44\" hspace=\"5\" src=\"/resources/strand/images/uploads/admit-one-icon-44px.jpg\" style=\"line-height: 19.2px;\" vspace=\"3\" width=\"44\">\r\n</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\tBuy a copy of <em>Power Play</em><i>\u00a0</i>or a $15 gift card in-store at the Strand's main floor registers or at the door to attend.

The genre\u2019s power is in the ability to cloak our human frailties, ugliness, triumphs, and beauty in an alien package for audiences to open and revel in, grapple with. Little are we necessarily conscious of how thin and permeable the membrane between fiction and reality actually is.\u00a0\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">We will look at the Borg of Star Trek lore and seek to identify their ultimate goal of assimilation with the sort of assimilation that occurs in the everyday lives of immigrant communities and communities of color. What happens when you live multiple lives in order to survive? Who is your authentic self? And when your outer identity\u2014namely race\u2014is assimilated by the culture at large, what are the consequences of your inner identity\u2019s mismatch?\u00a0</span>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Clare Kendry is Nella Larsen\u2019s embodiment of how explosive these consequences can be in her novel, Passing. We will look at Clare as another fictional example and talk about mental health concerns regarding the very real and ongoing struggle between being one of them and being who you are. It is imperative to have a conversation acknowledging racial division and colorism in order to explain fully why not all people have have these devisive experiences and more importantly, to understand why these experiences exist.</span>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Patricia Kim received her MFA from Columbia University and has been teaching College Composition and Literature classes at Baruch College and around NY while completing a novel.

Yet, inevitably, crime has a way of intruding on their lives all the same. A surgeon finds himself forced into performing a risky procedure on a narco killer. A teacher struggles to protect lovestruck students whose forbidden romance has put them in mortal peril. A painter\u2019s freewheeling ways land him in the back of a kidnapper\u2019s car. Again and again, the walls between \u201cordinary life\u201d and cartel violence are shown to be paper thin, and when they collapse the consequences are life-changing.<span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">\u00a0</span>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThese are stories about transformation and danger, passion and heartbreak, terror and triumph. They are funny, deeply moving, and stunningly well-crafted, and they tap into the most universal and enduring human experiences: \u00a0love even in the face of danger and loss, the struggle to grow and keep faith amidst hardship and conflict, and the pursuit of authenticity and courage over apathy and oppression. With unflinching honesty and exquisite tenderness, Josh Barkan masterfully introduces us to characters that are full of life--join us on the Strand's second floor for a reading from this collection, and mark the arrival of a uniquely assured and essential voice in American fiction.\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 12px;\">\r\n\t<img align=\"left\" alt=\"\" height=\"44\" hspace=\"5\" src=\"/resources/strand/images/uploads/admit-one-icon-44px.jpg\" style=\"line-height: 19.2px;\" vspace=\"3\" width=\"44\">\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 12px;\">\r\n\tCopies of <em>Mexico </em>will be available for purchase at the event. The event will take place in the photography section on the second floor of the Strand at 828 Broadway (at 12th Street).\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Additional Praise for <em>MEXICO</em>:</span></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\u201c<em>Mexico</em> is a remarkable achievement. It is a portrait of a nation told from an astonishing range of characters, examining their daily lives in the wake of the violence created by the drug cartels. With great authority and compassion, Josh Barkan explores the human cost of this violence, looking at this world with an eye that is both uncompromising and tender. The stories are beautiful, funny, and terrifying; Barkan has created a collection that is utterly riveting and necessary. This is fiction of the highest order; read it now.\u201d\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">\u2014 Karen Bender, author of <em>Refund</em> (National Book Award Finalist, 2015)</span>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">\u201c<em>Mexico</em> is a poignant and original collection of stories. \u2018In Mexico, everything\u2019s about excess\u2019 a narrator explains, and Josh Barkan proves this truth at every turn. He also reminds us that short stories, when beautifully written, are never short.\u201d\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">\u2014 Jennifer Clement, author of <em>Prayers for the Stolen</em> (PEN/Faulkner Award Finalist, 2015)</span>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">\u201cMacabre, outrageously funny, touching, and irresistibly readable, the stories in this collection depict with boldness the complexity, and madness, of contemporary Mexican society. The ensemble of diverse voices narrating these tales is mind-blowing. We have here the work of an original, terrifying, and spectacularly gifted storyteller.\u201d\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">\u2014 Jaime Manrique, author of <em>Cervantes Street</em></span>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">\u201c\u2018Do you think you can stomach such a story?\u2019 one woman asks another in <em>Mexico</em>, Josh Barkan\u2019s impressive new collection. He possesses the skill, nerve, and compassion to tell unforgettable stories from across the border, stories that are by turns violent, tender, heart-breaking, haunted, and surprising, rendered with such exacting care that readers will answer that question with a resounding Yes.\u201d\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">\u2014 Christopher Merrill, author of <em>The Tree of the Doves: Ceremony, Expedition, War</em>; director of the International Writing Program at the University of Iowa</span>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">\u201c<em>Mexico </em>is a marvel. Josh Barkan has created a suite of stories that are beautiful and harrowing, wise and comic. His heroes, mostly American expats who have headed south to reinvigorate their lives, are continually cast into danger and forced to reckon with the darkness that lives around them, and within them. And yet, the wonder of these stories is their ability to guide us through this rough terrain without descending into cynicism. As readers, and humans, we are inspired by these tales to \u2018sing in some way of beauty, to raise the spirit of our voices in hope.\u2019\u201d\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">\u2014 Steve Almond, author of <em>The Evil B.B. Chow and Other Stories</em> and <em>Candyfreak</em></span>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">\u201cRaw, strange, beautiful, the stories bring us into the heart of a very dangerous country, which is Mexico, and something else, which is ourselves.\u201d\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">\u2014 Peter Behrens, author of <em>Carry Me</em> (winner of the 2006 Governor General\u2019s Award, Canada)</span>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">\u201cBarkan\u2019s collection will thrill anyone curious about what goes on behind closed doors in contemporary Mexico. These tales mic the seductive voices of the marginal and lost. With a ventriloquist\u2019s skill, Barkan gets his speakers to lure you up surprising steps: toward a sacrificial plateau where anyone might steal your heart, including the notorious drug lord El Chapo as well as your neighborhood soldier and corner prostitute. Barkan\u2019s prose is empathic and lucid in stories too fantastic to be anything but real.\u201d\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">\u2014 Edie Meidav, author of <em>Kingdom of the Young</em> and <em>Lola, California</em></span>\r\n</p>\r\n</div>",

	"description": "<div class=\"event__description\"><p>\r\n\tEisenhower cautioned us against the military one; if only Orson Welles had warned us about the vastly more insidious assemblage, the Entertainment-Industrial Complex. Reality has become much less real (and less important) in contemporary American society. America is a country that came of age with Industrialization and was accompanied by the creation of a mass media public sphere. More often than is desirable, people\u2019s favorite binge show is more important to them than what goes on in the real world. How does this retreat into a fantasy world evidence itself in our real world politics today? Let's talk about how fantasy has bled into reality and try to understand what it means for the future of our country.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDr. J.

It is moderated by Lisa Naftolin, Creative Director, Publishing and Digital Media at the Guggenheim. The evening includes a reading from the catalogue by Brian Kuan Wood, book signing, and light reception.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tA conceptual extension of the exhibition Tales of Our Time, the catalogue edited by Xiaoyu Weng and Hou Hanru blends a traditional museum publication with a fiction anthology. Featuring scholarly essays and artwork descriptions, it unconventionally examines the exhibition artists and challenges current views about art from China. Interwoven with these essays are seven commissioned short stories by Chinese and American fiction writers Han Song, Hon Lai-chu, Li Juan, Ken Liu, Lo Yi-chin, Wang Bang, and Brian Kuan Wood. The exhibition and accompanying catalogue offer a heterogeneous view of contemporary art and culture from China, highlighting tensions between individual narratives and mainstream history as well as exploring how the gaps between the two can be transcended.\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 12px;\">\r\n\t<img align=\"left\" alt=\"\" height=\"44\" hspace=\"5\" src=\"/resources/strand/images/uploads/admit-one-icon-44px.jpg\" style=\"line-height: 19.2px;\" vspace=\"3\" width=\"44\">\r\n</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\tBuy a copy of <i>Tales of Our Time\u00a0</i>or a $20 gift card in-store at the Strand's main floor registers or at the door to attend.

Sometimes knowingly, but more oftentimes not. Those snippets are then recorded, reconfigured, and redistributed in ways that few people really understand. The United States presently has the weakest information privacy laws among all of the advanced democracies.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHow did we get here? Why didn't we see this coming?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis lecture examines the history of large-scale data collection in America from the first census in 1790 to the present day. Topics will include the rise of the welfare state, the advent of mainframe computers, early social and political debates over data privacy and protection, the many problems inherent to the misuse of personal data, and what privacy advocates are presently doing about all this. Front-and-center will be an examination of the all too familiar statement: \u201cIf you\u2019re doing nothing wrong then you should have nothing to hide.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLeading this lecture is Lawrence Cappello, historian and privacy advocate.

	"description": "<div class=\"event__description\"><p>\r\n\tUnexpected, humorous, sometimes dark, and surprisingly heartfelt, here are tales that explore the secret life of men as they pass into adulthood, middle age, and old age confronting lust, pain, guilt, bewilderment, and mortality. O\u2019Leary has won numerous literary awards for his stories and his title story was a finalist for the Mark Twain Award for Humor Writing. The collection fearlessly distills for the reader tinctures of joy, pain, madness, heartbreak, greed, and other components of the human capacity for good and evil, for beauty and ugliness. O'Leary showcases humanity in a fluent, fun read, which will let you peek into the most intimate and the well familiar entrails of existence. Few books around these days possess the capability to bring both a tear to your eye and smile to your lips, within the span of a few chapters, such as this work does.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTim will be joined in conversation by Stuart Elliott, former advertising/media reporter turned freelance writer at Media Village.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrior to the talk guitarist Christopher White will perform his song \"Dick Cheney Shot Me In The Face\".\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 12px;\">\r\n\t<img align=\"left\" alt=\"\" height=\"44\" hspace=\"5\" src=\"/resources/strand/images/uploads/admit-one-icon-44px.jpg\" style=\"line-height: 19.2px;\" vspace=\"3\" width=\"44\">\r\n</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\tBuy a copy of\u00a0<i>Dick Cheney Shot Me in the Face\u00a0</i>or a $15 gift card in-store at the Strand's main floor registers or at the door to attend.

	"description": "<div class=\"event__description\"><p>\r\n\tHarold Garfinkel argued that sociocultural structures were evident in the satisfaction of them \u2013 and in the breach. His theory, ethnomethodology, in part reveals how participants' reactions to this breach show us the limits of a given structure, its categories, its characteristics. In this Olio, I suggest that the Amazon hit show Transparent is an ideal example of Garfinkel\u2019s theory. Some have critiqued the show for focusing too little on Maura, the title character, and her transition journey. We will explore the extent to which Maura\u2019s transition is intended as a moment that creates a temporary breach in her family structure, making transparent the structure of this Jewish family in L.A. as they respond.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMaureen T.

From the mining hostels in the 1800\u2019s to the dance halls of Apartheid-era Soweto; the mixing of Arabic, Malay, Khoi and San ancestry in the carnival troupes of the Cape; the musical styles of Goema, Marabi, Mbaqanga and Samba; the influence of John Coltrane and Thelonious Monk\u2019s jazz scene in New York; and the free jazz movements of the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s; all helped shape the rich tradition of South African jazz. Musicians like Zim Ngqawana, the Blue Notes and the more recent Amanda Freedom Ensemble have strong links to what is happening socially while maintaining a firm grip on the jazz tradition. The coexistence of social issues with the musical tradition, is the essence of jazz to many people. The past few years has seen student uprisings across South Africa. At the heart of the uprisings is the fact that for most people South Africa did not change much from it\u2019s Apartheid days. The uprisings are driving a decolonizing and inter-sectional movement aimed at dismantling structural racism, patriarchy and the exploitation of workers by neoliberal capitalism.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis class focuses on the role that jazz musicians have played in shaping radical liberation politics and the liberation politics that have in turn shaped jazz in South Africa. Sure jazz isn't listened to by every revolutionary but the spirit that drives the music is revolutionary and many musicians and artists have used their voices to create a social scene for resistance to flourish.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>*Performance and Art exhibit to follow the class*</strong> Musician and activist William Parker will join forces with South African musicians Kesivan Naidoo, Abraham Mennen and Brooklyn born Dan Kurfirst in a performance following the lecture.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLeading the class is Sean Jacobs, an associate professor of International Affairs at The New School where he teaches courses that explore the connections between popular culture and politics.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe presenting beer sponsor is\u00a0<a href=\"http://sixpoint.com/\">Sixpoint Brewery</a>.

The ancient text addresses a time when the existing world order appears to be crumbling. Not only has the traditional political order been swept away; meritocracy, values and ethics no longer hold sway. Society is in a process of dissolution; and a powerful king asserts his absolute power, exceeding even the eternal law (dharma). Sound familiar?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnd yet the epic undertakes to restate the concept of ethics in a time of upheaval. Containing a critique of technology, rampant materialism and self-serving individualism, the epic appears surprisingly contemporary. It offers philosophical insight into how humans can flourish in a troubled time.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn this Olio we will attempt to understand and analyze our situation as Americans and humans in light of the Mahabharata. We will analyze contemporary democratic society which is based on the virtues of freedom and prestige rather than obligation, tradition and merit and see if we can find contemporary relevance in this ancient text.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tVishwa Adluri teaches Philosophy and Religion at Hunter College NY.

	"description": "<div class=\"event__description\"><p>\r\n\t\"Cited by many critics as one of the most important American novels ever written, <em>On the Road</em> nonetheless continues to polarize readers, sparking intense debate, or even eye-rolling dismissal. But how should we read Kerouac\u2019s overt sexism? At best, many readers have reluctantly accepted the author\u2019s misogyny as reminiscent of an era, while still managing to celebrate the genius of his prose. At worst, in the eyes of many critics, Kerouac\u2019s sexism has rendered him a pathetic creep, unworthy of redemption.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut perhaps, both arguments are missing the broader potential for radical feminist liberation weaved into the mad man\u2019s scroll. Beyond my interrogation of Kerouac\u2019s <em>On the Road</em>, I want this Olio to go a bit deeper and introspective on a personal level, with the express purpose of revealing, for myself and those listening, what it is really like to be a woman and a reader. I state these two things separately\u2014woman, reader\u2014with intention. Because as a cultural historian, I believe we construct our notions of self by engaging in and producing shared cultural narratives, and in this world, woman and reader are two distinct things.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo what is it like, then, to be a woman who reads in a world where most authors are men? What is it like to search for yourself on the page, only to find yourself the joke, the insult, the unnamed, the bitch? What is it like to find yourself identifying so completely with a male subject\u2019s perspective that you begin to question your own subjectivity?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI want to address these dilemmas by exploring my relationship to Kerouac and other male writers, with the hope that I can offer up some new possibilities for how women might know themselves as readers. Misogyny is ingrained in so much of the literature we love, but I believe there is a way to turn the act of reading into an act of feminist subversion.

Populist demagogues are on the rise, scapegoating refugees, immigrants and minorities. Those populists channel a toxic blend of nativism, xenophobia, racism and Islamaphobia while dismissing universal human rights as unaffordable luxuries or worse, dangerous liabilities to a secure society. These trends pose a visceral threat to the very real accomplishments of the international human rights movement.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhat is the relevance of human rights in the aftermath of Aleppo and the emergency of autocrats exploiting the alienation of people left behind by the social and economic dislocations of globalization? Is the defense of universal human rights values the antidote to this spreading virus of intolerance, or have the failures and contradictions of the human rights movement relegated it to the status of a failed experiment in 20th century optimism?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJoin the resistance with Hunter College Adjunct Professor Phelim Kine as he unpacks the evolution of the modern international human rights movement, dissects its challenges and makes the case that a robust defense of universal human rights is essential in back against the darkness of autocracy and intolerance.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPhelim Kine is an adjunct professor at Hunter College and a deputy director in Human Rights Watch\u2019s Asia Division. He has spoken publicly on Asia\u2019s human rights challenges at venues ranging from the European Parliament and the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong to the Council on Foreign Relations and a hearing of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC).\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe presenting beer sponsor is Sixpoint Brewery.

But when she saw him perform in front of thousands of screaming fans for the first time, she knew that rock stardom was meant to be for her son. And as Virginia watched her son's star rise, she often wondered about the other mothers who raised sons and daughters who became rock stars. Were they as surprised as she was about their children's fame? Did they worry about their children's livelihood and wellbeing in an industry fraught with drugs and other dangers? Did they encourage their children's passions despite the odds against success, or attempt to dissuade them from their grandiose dreams? Do they remind their kids to pack a warm coat when they go on tour?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tVirginia decided to seek out other rock star mothers to ask these questions, and so began a two-year odyssey in which she interviewed such women as Verna Griffin, Dr. Dre's mother; Marianne Stipe, Michael Stipe of REM's mother; Janis Winehouse, Amy Winehouse's mother; Patsy Noah, Adam Levine's mother; Donna Haim, mother of the Haim sisters; and Hester Diamond, Mike D of The Beastie Boys' mother.\u00a0\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Virginia and her son Dave Grohl will be at the Strand to launch </span><em style=\"font-size: 1em;\">From Cradle to Stage\u00a0</em>and discuss the demands of raising and growing up to be a rock star.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Please Note: </strong>Books will be pre-signed by Virginia Grohl.

Beyond this, we will look at what may tip the scale to create fractures within a relationship and how to avoid many common pitfalls.

David Owen traces all that water from the Colorado's headwaters to its parched terminus, once a verdant wetland but now a million-acre desert. He takes readers on an adventure downriver, along a labyrinth of waterways, reservoirs, power plants, farms, fracking sites, ghost towns, and RV parks, to the spot near the U.S.\u2013Mexico border where the river runs dry.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWater problems in the western United States can seem tantalizingly easy to solve: just turn off the fountains at the Bellagio, stop selling hay to China, ban golf, cut down the almond trees, and kill all the lawyers. But a closer look reveals a vast man-made ecosystem that is far more complex and more interesting than the headlines let on.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe story Owen tells in <em>Where the Water Goes</em> is crucial to our future: how a patchwork of engineering marvels, byzantine legal agreements, aging infrastructure, and neighborly cooperation enables life to flourish in the desert, and the disastrous consequences we face when any part of this tenuous system fails.

	"description": "<div class=\"event__description\"><p>\r\n\tThis compelling approach to the immigration debate takes the reader behind the blaring headlines and into communities grappling with the reality of new immigrants and the changing nature of American identity. Ali Noorani, the Executive Director of the National Immigration Forum, interviews nearly fifty local and national leaders from law enforcement, business, immigrant, and faith communities to illustrate the challenges and opportunities they face. From high school principals to church pastors to sheriffs, the author reveals that most people are working to advance society's interests, not exploiting a crisis at the expense of one community. As he shows, some cities and regions have reached a happy conclusion, while others struggle to find balance.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhether describing a pastor preaching to the need to welcome the stranger, a sheriff engaging the Muslim community, or a farmer's wind-whipped face moistened by tears as he tells the story of his farmworkers being deported, the author helps readers to realize that America's immigration debate isn't about policy; it is about the culture and values that make America what it is. The people on the front lines of America's cultural and demographic debate are Southern Baptist pastors in South Carolina, attorneys general in Utah or Indiana, Texas businessmen, and many more. Their combined voices make clear that all of them are working to make America a welcome place for everyone, long-established citizens and new arrivals alike.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJoin Ali in conversation with Juan Williams,<span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">\u00a0Fox News analyst and columnist at The Hill, to hear the diverse voices in this inspiring book come together with hope for the future</span><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">.\u00a0</span>\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 12px;\">\r\n\t<img align=\"left\" alt=\"\" height=\"44\" hspace=\"5\" src=\"/resources/strand/images/uploads/admit-one-icon-44px.jpg\" style=\"line-height: 19.2px;\" vspace=\"3\" width=\"44\">\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 12px;\">\r\n\tBuy a copy of <i>There Goes the Neighborhood or a\u00a0</i>\u00a0$15 gift card in-store at the Strand's main floor registers or at the door to attend.

Using his own story: his Southern roots, the epiphanic moment when he had his change of heart, as well as those of the women he serves, Dr. Parker presents the Christian case for abortion.\u00a0\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHe also looks at how a new wave of anti-abortion activism, aimed at making incremental changes in laws and regulations state by state are slowly chipping away at the rights of women to control their own lives. In revealing his daily battle against mandatory waiting periods and bogus rules governing the width of hallways, Dr. Parker uncovers the growing number of strings attached to the right to choose\u2014strings that are particularly straining to poor women and women of color.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJoining Dr. Parker in conversation is playwright Winter Miller.\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 12px;\">\r\n\t<img align=\"left\" alt=\"\" height=\"44\" hspace=\"5\" src=\"/resources/strand/images/uploads/admit-one-icon-44px.jpg\" style=\"line-height: 19.2px;\" vspace=\"3\" width=\"44\">\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 12px;\">\r\n\tBuy a copy of\u00a0<i>Life's Work\u00a0</i>or a $15 gift card in-store at the Strand's main floor registers or at the door to attend.

Sex is a ritualistic act that induces altered states, perhaps the prototypical religious ritual. Certain mushrooms have evolved to induce a very similar experience in mammals. There are many ways people (and even animals) manipulate their bodies and environment to achieve these highly desired states. Yet, the line between drugs and medicine is often arbitrarily drawn and driven by political and economic forces. The wholesale worldwide banning of all hallucinatory drugs in 1973 should give us pause. Even more interesting is the recent explosion of research into medicinal uses of these formerly banned substances. What should our relationship be with these pervasive plants? - Michael D. Haltenberger\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe challenge faced by artists and mystics is the description and representation of what we, for lack of a better term, call the ineffable. \u201cThe Ineffable\u201d can be said to be the real experience witnessed when we transcend the material limits of the universe, when we go beyond the usual limits of perception. Although contemporary art is now thought of as being primarily secular, there is a more ancient standpoint from which to view art, religion and the ingestion of mind-expanding substances. For millennia, both artists and mystics have used psychoactive substances and sacred plants as a gateway. These practices have survived criminalization and marginalization for a very good reason - they work. - J. Michael Prettyman\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis class will be led by Michael Haltenberger and Michael Prettyman. Michael &amp; Michael lectures are committed to the idea of community learning. It allows teachers and learners to gather around a subject rather than a professor downloading info into students as if they are empty vessels waiting to be filled. This approach emphasizes the primacy of community as the most valuable source of knowledge and wisdom.

As we enter an unprecedented period in U.S. history, many communities\u2014immigrants, Muslims, people of color, gay and transgender people, and women, to name a few\u2014are bracing themselves for a four-year period of bitterly divisive rhetoric and increased vulnerability. This climate goes against the values of many millions of Americans, from all walks of life.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis collection of letters addresses the tumult and danger of these times, through a range of leading contemporary voices. The thirty-one original letters and essays written for this anthology are woven into a passionate narrative, and divided into three sections: \u201cRoots\u201d explores the histories that bring us to this moment, with many letters addressed to ancestors; \u201cBranches\u201d addresses present-day people or communities\u2014a stranger in the supermarket, Baby Boomers, Millennials, white people, artists, the protestors at Standing Rock\u2014and delves into complex questions of our current era; and, finally, \u201cSeeds\u201d looks to the future by speaking to new generations, to sons and daughters, to godchildren, or to imagined children yet to be born, all of them inheritors of what happens now. The anthology offers readers an antidote to despair: it is a salve, a balm, a compass, a rallying cry, a lyrical manifesto, a power source, a torch to light the way forward. It is both provocative and inspiring, and offers a kaleidoscopic view of the love and courage needed to navigate this time of upheaval, uncertainty, and fear.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJoining <a href=\"http://www.carolinaderobertis.com/\">Carolina de Robertis</a>, editor of <em>Radical Hope</em>, will be <a href=\"http://www.monaeltahawy.com/\">Mona Eltahawy</a>, author of\u00a0<em>Headscarves and Hymens: Why the Middle East Needs a Sexual Revolution</em>, and <a href=\"http://borisfishman.com/bio/\">Boris Fishman</a>, author of <em>Don't Let My Baby Do Rodeo </em>and writer at \u00a0the <em>New Yorker</em>, the <em>New York Times Magazine </em>and <em>Book Review</em>, the <em>New Republic, </em>and elsewhere.\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 12px;\">\r\n\t<img align=\"left\" alt=\"\" height=\"44\" hspace=\"5\" src=\"/resources/strand/images/uploads/admit-one-icon-44px.jpg\" style=\"line-height: 19.2px;\" vspace=\"3\" width=\"44\">\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 12px;\">\r\n\tBuy a copy of\u00a0<i>Radical Hope\u00a0</i>or a $15 gift card in-store at the Strand's main floor registers or at the door to attend.

In the twenty-first century, some female creators began to challenge the tropes of the genre. Rather than taking a prosecutorial or detached tone, these women explore their emotional enmeshment in the story. Books like <em>The Red Parts</em> (Maggie Nelson) and <em>Men We Reaped </em>(Jesmyn Ward) are told achronologically, disturbing established timelines to foreground how trauma reverberates in the families and communities of victims. Similarly, podcasts resurrect and refashion an older medium\u2014radio shows\u2014to experiment with storytelling that dismantles the conceit that true crime stories can be contained within tidy, journalistic narratives.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn this Olio, we will read and listen to examples where women have narratively and formally decentered the \u201ctruth,\u201d foregrounded the creative process, and created a space for empathy and community in a way that could be called feminist.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTracy L. Bealer received her Ph.D. from the University of South Carolina, and currently teaches literature and composition at Borough of Manhattan Community College.

Why Writing Well Matters, by Sir Harold Evans, one of the great editors of our time. His insistent theme is that writing well matters because words have consequences. The bursting of the housing bubble that led to the Great Recession revealed that millions had signed agreements they hadn\u2019t understood. \u00a0Insurance policies for medical treatment or flood and wind damage turn out not to cover what the language suggests they covered. And now the attorneys general in Illinois and Washington, backed by a coalition of 27 other states, have filed lawsuits accusing Sallie Mae of subprime notoriety and its spinoff, Navient, of duping hundreds of thousands of students into accepting loans designed to fail.\u00a0\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEvans calls the words that confuse and deceive people \u201cthe fog.\u201d He writes: \u201cFog everywhere. Fog online and in print, fog exhaled in television studios where time is anyway too short for truth.

Thrasher as they discuss James Baldwin\u2019s The Fire Next Time, now available in a special illustrated edition from TASCHEN featuring photographs by Steve Schapiro.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFirst published in 1963, James Baldwin\u2019s <em>The Fire Next Time</em> stabbed at the heart of America\u2019s so-called \u201cNegro problem.\u201d As remarkable for its masterful prose as it is for its frank and personal account of the black experience in the United States, it is considered one of the most passionate and influential explorations of 1960s race relations, weaving thematic threads of love, faith, and family into a candid assault on the hypocrisy of the \u201cland of the free.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNow, James Baldwin\u2019s rich, raw, and ever relevant prose is reprinted in a letterpress edition with more than 100 photographs from Steve Schapiro, who traveled the American South with Baldwin for Life magazine. The encounter thrust Schapiro into the thick of the movement, allowing for vital, often iconic, images both of civil rights leaders\u2014including Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks, Fred Shuttlesworth, and Jerome Smith\u2014and such landmark events as the March on Washington and the Selma March.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tRounding out the edition are Schapiro\u2019s stories from the field, a new introduction by civil rights legend and U.S. Congressman John Lewis, captions by Marcia Davis of The Washington Post, and an essay by Gloria Baldwin Karefa-Smart, who was with her brother James in Sierra Leone when he started to work on the story. The result is a remarkable visual and textual record of one of the most important and enduring struggles of the American experience. Marking the year of the original publication of the book and Schapiro\u2019s photographs, The Fire Next Time is limited to 1,963 copies.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSteve will be in conversation with poet Quincy Troupe and writer Steven W.

They help him feel a little better about being an alien and help remind us that sometimes it takes an outsider to have us see ourselves for who we truly are.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJonny will be in conversation with poet Sarah Kay.

	"description": "<div class=\"event__description\"><p>\r\n\tEnvironmental degradation is one of the 21st centuries most pressing concerns. Our unsustainable relationship with Nature is fueled by a long held view in Western thought that Man is separate from Nature. This Olio will attempt to provide a quick historical overview (beginning with Plato and working through the Western philosophical tradition) of the views that support this problematic relationship.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut knowing that a problem exists isn\u2019t enough. What should be done to deal with it? Currently, the environmental literature is divided on how to best conceptualize the notion of responsibility in environmental crises. I contend there are two main competing schools of thought: (1) the Anthropic (undifferentiated responsibility) and (2) the Environmental Justice (differentiated responsibility).\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn this Olio I will briefly summarize these two views and demonstrate their respective strengths and weaknesses and afterwards offer a model of responsibility based heavily on Iris Marion Young\u2019s account that I believe integrates the best features of each approach. My hope is that the discussion will provide us all with a better idea of how we can actually go about discharging our responsibility for environmental harms.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tManuel Rodeiro teaches in the Philosophy department at Baruch College.

In our age of growing inequality, the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher. Every American needs to read this book.\u201d \u2014 Senator Elizabeth Warren\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLike the work of Robert Reich, Joseph Stiglitz, and Thomas Piketty, <em>THE CRISIS OF THE MIDDLE CLASS CONSTITUTION: Why Economic Inequality Threatens Our Republic </em>by Ganesh Sitaraman is an original, provocative contribution to the debate over rising economic inequality. Sitaraman argues that economic inequality is more than just a moral or economic problem; it threatens the very core of our constitutional system.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tA former policy director and senior counsel for Elizabeth Warren and now a law professor at Vanderbilt and a Senior Fellow at the Center for American Progress, Sitaraman believes that the disappearance of the American middle class in the last two decades has greater consequences for our democracy than we\u2019ve ever understood.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tToday, Sitaraman says Americans face a choice: will we accept rising economic inequality\u2014and risk oligarchy\u2014or will we rebuild the middle class and reclaim our republic?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJoin us for a conversation and signing to follow. This event will be located in Strand's 3rd Floor Rare Book Room.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGanesh Sitaraman is an Associate Professor of Law at Vanderbilt Law School and a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. He has been a longtime advisor to Senator Elizabeth Warren, serving as her policy director and senior counsel. Sitaraman has commented on foreign and domestic policy in The New York Times, The New Republic, The Boston Globe, and The Christian Science Monitor. He is the author of The Counterinsurgent's Constitution: Law in the Age of Small Wars, which won the Palmer Prize for Civil Liberties in 2013. He is a graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law School, where he was an editor on the Harvard Law Review.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<img align=\"left\" alt=\"\" height=\"44\" hspace=\"5\" src=\"/resources/strand/images/uploads/admit-one-icon-44px.jpg\" style=\"line-height: 19.2px;\" vspace=\"3\" width=\"44\">\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">This event is free to attend.</span><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1757071614608375/\">\u00a0</a>Reserve a copy of\u00a0</span><i>The Crisis of the Middle Class Constitution</i><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.strandbooks.com/product/the-crisis-of-the-middle-class-constitution-why-economic-inequality-threatens-our-republic\">here</a>!</span><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">\u00a0The event will take place in the Strand's Rare Book Room on the third floor at our store at 828 Broadway at 12th Street.</span>\r\n</p>\r\n</div>",

	"description": "<div class=\"event__description\"><p>\r\n\tDavid Weigel, national reporter at the Washington Post, is here to rescue the music of groups like Yes, Genesis, and Pink Floyd from the ridicule and derision heaped on it by decades of critics and pop culture, all the way back to Spinal Tap. Described by Rolling Stone as \"the deliciously decadent genre that the punks failed to kill,\" prog rock saw huge sales and even huger ideas--concept albums, wild and wooly cover art, advanced recording techniques, and, yes, stagecraft worthy of \"Stonehenge.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWeigel explains exactly what was \u201cprogressive\u201d about prog rock and how its complexity and experimentalism arose from such precursors as the Beach Boys\u2019 Pet Sounds and the Beatles\u2019 Sgt. Pepper. He traces prog\u2019s popularity from the massive success of Procol Harum\u2019s \u201cWhiter Shade of Pale\u201d and the Moody Blues\u2019 \u201cNights in White Satin\u201d in 1967. He reveals how prog\u2019s best-selling, epochal albums were made, including The Dark Side of the Moon, Thick as a Brick, and Tubular Bells. And he explores the rise of new instruments into the prog mix, such as the synthesizer, flute, mellotron, and?famously?the double-neck guitar.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Show That Never Ends is filled with the candid reminiscences of prog\u2019s celebrated musicians. It also features memorable portraits of the vital contributions of producers, empresarios, and technicians such as Richard Branson, Brian Eno, Ahmet Ertegun, and Bob Moog.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJoin Weigel, along with Best Show host, comedian, and fellow prog connoisseur Tom Scharpling, for a victorious tour of the resurgent genre that gave us classic records and a plenty of forgotten greatness.\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 12px;\">\r\n\t<img align=\"left\" alt=\"\" height=\"44\" hspace=\"5\" src=\"/resources/strand/images/uploads/admit-one-icon-44px.jpg\" style=\"line-height: 19.2px;\" vspace=\"3\" width=\"44\">\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 12px;\">\r\n\tBuy a copy of\u00a0<i>The Show That Never Ends\u00a0</i>or a $15 gift card in-store at the Strand's main floor registers or at the door to attend.

We've made it our mission in 2017 to read novels by women of all different backgrounds, races, ethnicities, social classes, religions, and sexualities. This month, the book club will be reading <em>Allegedly</em>\u00a0by Tiffany D. Jackson.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>Allegedly</em> tells the haunting and heart-wrenching story of Mary B. Addison, who killed a baby. Allegedly. Mary didn't say much in that first interview with detectives, and the media filled in the only blanks that mattered: A white baby had died while under the care of a churchgoing black woman and her nine-year-old daughter. The public convicted Mary and the jury made it official. But did she do it? She wouldn't say.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMary survived six years in juvenile hall before being dumped in a group home. But the house isn't really \"home\" \u2014 no place where you fear for your life can be considered a home. Home is Ted, who she meets on assignment at a nursing home. There wasn't a point to setting the record straight before, but now she's got Ted \u2014 and their unborn child \u2014 to think about. When the state threatens to take her baby, Mary must find the voice to fight her past. And her fate lies in the hands of the one person she distrusts the most: her Momma. No one knows the real Momma. But who really knows the real Mary?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis event will be located on the second floor of our store.\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 12px;\">\r\n\t<img align=\"left\" alt=\"\" height=\"44\" hspace=\"5\" src=\"/resources/strand/images/uploads/admit-one-icon-44px.jpg\" style=\"line-height: 19.2px;\" vspace=\"3\" width=\"44\">\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis event is free to attend.

Her body was a canvas of cruelty; each scar a mark of pride and shame.\u00a0</span>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn sharp and shocking language, <em>Lights On, Rats Out </em>brings us closely into these years. We see the world as Cree did, turned upside down, the richness of life muted and dulled, its pleasures perverted. The heady thrill of meeting with her psychiatrist, Dr. Adam N. Kohl, whose relationship with Cree is at once sustaining and paralyzing, comes to be the only bright spot in her days.\u00a0\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMoving deftly between the dialogue and observations from psychiatric records and elegant, incisive reflection on youth and early adulthood, <em>Lights On, Rats Out</em> illuminates a fiercely bright and independent woman\u2019s charged attachment to a mental health professional and the dangerous compulsion to keep him in her life at all costs.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJoin us in the rare books room as Cree shares her harrowing memoir.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<u><a href=\"http://www.strandbooks.com/biography-2/0731-event-lights-on-rats-out/_/searchString/cree%20lefavour\" style=\"color: #bf2e1a ; font-family: 'TradeGothicLTPro'; font-size: 18px; display: inline-block; margin: 10px 0; border: 1px solid #bf2e1a ; padding: 8px 20px;\">Event Admission</a></u>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<u><a href=\"http://www.strandbooks.com/pre-order-signed/lights-on-rats-out-a-memoir/_/searchString/cree%20lefavour\" style=\"color: #bf2e1a ; font-family: 'TradeGothicLTPro'; font-size: 18px; display: inline-block; margin: 10px 0; border: 1px solid #bf2e1a ; padding: 8px 20px;\">Signed Copy, No Admission</a> </u>\r\n</p>\r\n</div>",

	"description": "<div class=\"event__description\"><p>\r\n\tIn a 2010 <em>Guardian </em>column, writer Lindy West contemplated the stigma surrounding abortion: \u201cI live in a progressive city, I have a fiercely pro-choice social circle and family, I write confessionally about myself for a living. . . And I know how all [in my social circle] feel about abortion, policy wise. But I don\u2019t know who has had one, and they don\u2019t know about mine.\u201d West\u2019s personal insights reflect a national trend: abortion is such a contentious subject in American society that most women are reticent to discuss their own experience.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Regulatory legislature treats abortion as a mistake, rather than a right. Women are forced to have ultrasounds and undergo \"educational briefings\" that many opponents view as scare tactics. In her book, <em>About Abortion: Terminating Pregnancy in Twenty-First Century America</em>, legal scholar Carol Sanger tackles these issues and more by making connections between abortion law and cultural opinion. Carol looks forward toward medical progress and the advent of more free speech on the subject of abortion, she hopes that the decision of whether or not to become a mother will be treated with as much respect as any other serious choice in a woman's life. In the current political climate of the United States, marked by revived determination to close clinics, defund Planned Parenthood, and reverse Roe v. Wade, Sanger\u2019s original and much-needed book is more important than ever.</span>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Please join Carol, along with fellow authors and activists Amelia Bonow,\u00a0</span>Martha Plimpton,<span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">\u00a0and Regina Mahone, for a panel discussion of the state of abortion rights in America in the Rare Book Room.</span>\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 12px;\">\r\n\t<img align=\"left\" alt=\"\" height=\"44\" hspace=\"5\" src=\"/resources/strand/images/uploads/admit-one-icon-44px.jpg\" style=\"line-height: 19.2px;\" vspace=\"3\" width=\"44\">\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBuy a copy of\u00a0<em>About Abortion</em>\u00a0or a $15 gift card in-store at the Strand's main floor registers or at the door to attend.

He has observed tremendous success in the industry, having hosted multiple stand-up and comedy specials worldwide. After becoming the successor of\u00a0<em>The Daily Show</em> in 2015, he chronicled tales of his life growing up in South Africa during the death throes of apartheid and the ensuing aftermath in his biography. The book documents the harrowing struggles of Noah\u2019s early life growing up in poverty, as well as some quirky and frightening anecdotes from his adolescence and young adulthood. The words within are rife with Noah\u2019s particular brand of humor, making the storytelling at once arresting and at the same time, hilarious.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tChris Jackson is editor-in-chief of One World Publishing, a subsidiary of Random House. Chris is credited with revitalizing the diversity focused One World Imprint, which aims to proliferate, examine, and celebrate multicultural works of literature in order to enrich our society. His work has earned him the great respect of the literary community, so this discussion is not one to miss!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<img align=\"left\" alt=\"\" height=\"44\" hspace=\"5\" src=\"/resources/strand/images/uploads/admit-one-icon-44px.jpg\" style=\"line-height: 19.2px;\" vspace=\"3\" width=\"44\">\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\u00a0<span style=\"color: rgb(29, 33, 41); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; white-space: pre-wrap;\"> This event has sold out!

Let\u2019s talk about poetry as the thing-in-itself \u2013 ding-an-sich as intimidating hardcore German philosophers would say. Let\u2019s talk about Hedonism and Social Activism and look at some Ashbery and Stevens and Brecht.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Dial-a-Poem, Music, and Sparking Poetic Revolutions:</strong> Taught by Jessica Rogers\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn this Olio we will begin unpacking the history of John Giorno\u2019s Dial-a-Poem Series \u2013 from the phone lines and answering machines installed at MoMA in 1968, featuring provocative and diverse works by poets boldly confronting the Vietnam War, the sexual revolution, racial inequality, and increasingly the AIDS crisis, to a series of innovative vinyl records, VHS tapes, and CDs produced by Giorno Poetry Systems (GPS) in the 70s and 80s.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDiscussion of these works will ensue, facilitated by text copies of particular pieces (to be provided). If part of the purpose of Dial-a-Poem was to use new and accessible technologies to spark poetic revolution, what relevance can we draw in an era of digital phones and emails? And yet we are also seeing a resurgence of vinyl \u2013 last year record sales hit a 25-year high \u2013 how might Giorno Poetry Systems influence experimentation and collaboration in the arts and activism today?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe presenting beer sponsor is Sixpoint Brewery.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<img align=\"left\" alt=\"\" height=\"44\" hspace=\"5\" src=\"/resources/strand/images/uploads/admit-one-icon-44px.jpg\" style=\"line-height: 19.2px;\" vspace=\"3\" width=\"44\">\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis event has been cancelled.

In varying measures,<em> Handmaid\u2019s Tale</em> and <em>Fahrenheit 451</em> speak to the defining fears of our day: The rise of rabidly intolerant strains of politics and political leaders at home and abroad, a palpable realization that the \u201csomeday\u201d of climate change ravages are already defining our present and a creeping suspicion that the seemingly limitless interconnectivity of the digital era may ultimately prove more sinister and isolating than liberating.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAtwood and Bradbury channeled the gender dynamics and collective fears of their respective generations into chilling conceptions of the near-future that are as convincing as they are carefully-drawn.

Olio Double Features include two professors giving 30-minute, interdisciplinary talks on tangentially related topics.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tModern Art, Gender Roles, and the Work / Life Balance Taught by Jessica Murphy\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGeorgia O'Keeffe might be the most famous American woman artist of her generation, but she certainly wasn't the only one. This Olio introduces us to four other women who forged careers as professional artists in New York between 1900 and 1940. From Peggy Bacon's scenes of bohemian life to Isabel Whitney's depictions of a changing Brooklyn, from Florine Stettheimer's whimsical family portraits to Abastenia St. Leger Eberle's figures of immigrants and laborers, their art explored a range of subjects and styles.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnd these artists' personal stories are just as varied as their work, reminding us that the issues of \"work/life balance\" and women's shifting roles in male-dominated fields are nothing new. How did these four women define modern life and modern art for themselves? Join us and learn more.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFreelance and the Gig-Economy is Eating the American Dream Taught by Ward Regan\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis Olio examines the current state of employment in the US and the rise of the new economic world order. When 40% of the American work force are independent contractors and many people have steady jobs but with no benefits, it's not hard to see how the US employment landscape has changed significantly.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe last 40 years of American economic \u201cprogress\u201d has expanded the wealth gap to its largest in a century and introduced neoliberal business practices that put a stake in the heart of the \u201cAmerican Dream\u201d. This talk will look at the different economic and political forces that have wrought these changes and how American society has been transformed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe presenting beer sponsor is Sixpoint Brewery.

This is a book about an unlikely campaign that had an even more improbable ending: the closest outcome in history, and an unprecedented eight-month recount saga, which is pretty funny, in retrospect. It's a book about what happens when the nation's foremost progressive satirist gets a chance to serve in the United States Senate and, defying the low expectations of the pundit class, actually turns out to be good at it. It's a book about our deeply polarized, frequently depressing, occasionally inspiring political culture, written from inside the belly of the beast. In this candid personal memoir, the honorable gentleman from Minnesota takes his army of loyal fans along with him from <em>Saturday Night Live</em>, to the campaign trail, inside the halls of Congress, and behind the scenes of some of the most dramatic and/or hilarious moments of his new career in politics. Has Al Franken become a true Giant of the Senate? Franken asks readers to decide for themselves.\u00a0\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJoin the Strand in <strong>The Great Hall at Cooper Union (7 East 7th Street, New York, NY 10003)</strong> as Al Franken discusses his life in the United States Senate with Late Night host Seth Meyers!\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:.25in;line-height:normal\">\r\n\t<b><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:\r\n\"Times New Roman\"'>Event FAQ:</span></b><span style='font-size:9.0pt;\r\nfont-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"'><p></p></span>\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\r\n\t\u00a0\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:.25in;line-height:normal\">\r\n\t<span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:\r\n\"Times New Roman\"'>Q.

	"description": "<div class=\"event__description\"><p>\r\n\tFor decades video games have both entertained and intrigued the masses, opening up an entirely new realm of possibilities for storytellers around the world. But what does it take to actually create one of these interactive realms? How difficult can it really be? Jason Schreier is here with his new book <em>Blood, Sweat, and Pixels</em> to tell you making a game is incredibly difficult and every game that succeeds in getting made is a miracle.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGoing through the development process from indie gems like <em>Stardew Valley</em> to AAA blockbusters like <em>Destiny</em>, Jason takes readers through the chaotic journey of bringing a game to life with impossible schedules, technical nightmares, and unreasonable corporate demands. It\u2019s an odyssey of creativity that goes behind-the-scenes of several of today\u2019s popular games.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJoin us in the Rare Book Room as Jason joins game developers Amanda Gardner (<em>Perception</em>) and Bill Gardner (<em>Bioshock</em>) to discuss the ups-and-downs of video game development, moderated by Jake Baldino from the hit YouTube channel\u00a0<em>Gameranx</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t-\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJASON SCHREIER is the news editor at <em>Kotaku</em>, a leading website covering the industry and culture of video games, where he has developed a reputation for fearless reporting on a variety of tough industry subjects. He has also covered the video game world for <em>Wired</em>, and has contributed to a wide range of outlets including <em>The New York Times</em>,<em> Edge</em>, <em>Paste</em>,<em> Kill Screen</em>, and <em>The Onion News Network</em>. This is his first book.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAMANDA GARDNER: A life-long gamer, Amanda has been fully-immersed in the geek lifestyle for as long as she can remember. Amanda writes all the things - books, video games (<em>Perception</em>), parenting and mindfulness blog posts, you name it. When she\u2019s not writing, she\u2019s juggling her four children and teaching yoga. Amanda also serves as the Perception\u2019s producer, a role she was born for, considering all she does is chase after people anyway.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBILL GARDNER spent over twelve years in various design roles at Irrational Games. On games like <em>SWAT 4</em>, <em>BioShock </em>and <em>BioShock Infinite</em>, he worked as Level Designer, Lead Designer, Design Director and User Experience Specialist. He's had his hand in all aspects of Irrational's award-winning design, and even managed to walk away with a few accolades of his own. Now Creative Director at The Deep End Games, Bill spent the past three years on <em>Perception</em>, a video game about a blind woman exploring a haunted mansion. Now out for PS4/XB1/PC.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJAKE BALDINO is a producer of video game, entertainment, and technology related content and has fun doing it. He is a host, creator, and lead producer\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">of the hit channel <em>Gameranx</em> on YouTube and talks about all things movie and game related on his personal platform <em>BecauseVideoGames</em>.</span>\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 12px;\">\r\n\t<img align=\"left\" alt=\"\" height=\"44\" hspace=\"5\" src=\"/resources/strand/images/uploads/admit-one-icon-44px.jpg\" style=\"line-height: 19.2px;\" vspace=\"3\" width=\"44\">\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 12px;\">\r\n\tBuy a copy of\u00a0<i>Blood, Sweat, and Pixels\u00a0</i>or a $15 ticket in-store at the Strand's main floor registers or at the door to attend.

His first book, <em>Boy Meets Boy</em>, was published by Knopf Books for Young Readers in 2003. He has written numerous works featuring strong male gay characters, most notably <em>Boy Meets Boy</em> and <em>Naomi and Ely's No Kiss List</em>. Levithan works for Scholastic as an editorial director and is also the founding editor of PUSH, a young-adult imprint of Scholastic Press focusing on new voices and new authors.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCoe Booth was born and raised in the Bronx. She has a master\u2019s degree in psychology and has worked as a counselor for teenagers and families in crisis situations. She also has an MFA in Creative Writing from The New School. Her first novel <em>Tyrell</em> won the Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Young Adult Literature, and her novels <em>Kendra</em> and <em>Bronxwood</em> were selected by the American Library Association as Best Books for Young Adults. Her first middle-grade novel <em>Kinda Like Brothers</em> was selected as an ALA Notable Book for Children and an NPR Best Book of 2014.\u00a0\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAriel Schrag is the author of the novel <em>Adam</em> and the graphic memoirs <em>Awkward, Definition, Potential</em>, and <em>Likewise</em>. Her new graphic memoir, <em>Part of It</em>, is forthcoming in fall 2018.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis event will be featured by CSPAN.\r\n</p>\r\n</div>",

As the Civil Rights movement heated up, his mom\u2019s trips across the tracks increased, causing her husband to abuse her as revenge. On a cold night when he was only 14, Scott disappeared into a Kansas snowstorm to escape the problems brought on by an unhappy home, his mother following behind.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn running away, Scott and his mother found a new life, one that included Jefferson Jackson, the black Baptist preacher who became Scott\u2019s surrogate father. Together, the new family lived in hiding and in poverty, conditions which inspired Scott to climb the highest ladders of international charities in hopes of helping children in need. He has since served as senior vice president of World Vision U.S. and vice president of PATH before joining Global Impact as President and CEO, striving to stop cycles of abuse, racism, and inequality.\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 12px;\">\r\n\t<img align=\"left\" alt=\"\" height=\"44\" hspace=\"5\" src=\"/resources/strand/images/uploads/admit-one-icon-44px.jpg\" style=\"line-height: 19.2px;\" vspace=\"3\" width=\"44\">\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis event is free to attend.

Many associate the band with their music video incarnations of the MTV 80s, but the Talking Heads were laying down dystopic lyrics atop funky bass lines throughout the late 1970s. Years before MTV dropped their first video in 1981, the Talking Heads released an unprecedented string cult classics; the group put out an album a year from 1977-1980: \u201977, More Songs about Buildings and Food, Fear of Music, and Remain in Light. All four albums were produced by glam rock legend Brian Eno, at a time when he was also helping to amplify NYC\u2019s downtown no wave scene. </span></span>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\t<div class=\"_1mf _1mj\" data-offset-key=\"1blvd-0-0\" style=\"position: relative; white-space: pre-wrap; direction: ltr; text-align: left; font-family: inherit;\">\r\n\t\t\u00a0\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhile many of us remember the beats, it\u2019s easy to overlook insightfulness of their lyrics \u2013 much of the lyricism of the Talking Heads thrives on the urban environment of 1970s and early 80s NYC, a city verging on bankruptcy and decay, the post-Vietnam War era in the US, glorifying the inspiration in the grit while cautioning against the commodification of culture. And yet, there is often an uneasy relationship with commodity in the Talking Heads\u2019 songs \u2013 our love/hate relationship with convenience, the necessity to understand yet a deep fear of the numbing suburbs, an unsettling critique of the government and the suits, Reaganomics dissected but never mentioned by name.\u00a0\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">In 2013, David Byrne wrote a much discussed article about how rising income inequality in cities like New York, is choking the artistic genius out of the city as well as our vibrant cultural scene, yet he says artists need the city and the city needs artists to thrive, and we all need NYC in better shape than it was in the late 1970s.

I.e the student is given information yet no instruction on how to put it into action in daily life.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis Olio discusses the work of Freud and Nietzche to demonstrate the need for a different kind of humanities which is not merely materialistic. The conception of the hero plays a central role in Nietzche and Freud's construction of humanities, and within their writings we meet with two different aspects of the hero. There is the straight forward hero who slays the monster and the Oedipus type of (anti) hero who kills the father.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe will uncover the relationship between these two conceptions of the hero and in doing so, we'll take up the secret battle between instinct and knowledge and the role it plays in humanities today.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tVishwa Adluri teaches Philosophy and Religion at Hunter College NY.

When Adam Gopnik and his fiancee Martha emigrated to New York from the comfort of their home in Montreal, the city then, much like today, was a destination for the young, the artsy, and the ambitious. However, under the surface, it was becoming a city that catered to it's wealthiest citizens, where pleasures and comforts would go only those greedy enough to snatch them by use of their stature. <em>At the Stranger's Gate</em> portrays this era of New York through the story of this couple's journey--from the moment they set foot on the island as aspiring artists, to the establishment of their family.

In trying to define what your voice is, it's helpful in figuring what your voice is not: there is great value of trying to learn someone else's language in order to help you define your own.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe boundaries of the different genres of music, from classical to folk to jazz to metal to (you name it) all have such different ways of capturing that voice: from the creation of music in the moment, to the presentation of music as a fixed product. In this Olio, we take a look at the transition and performance practice from \"classical music\" to \"free jazz\" through the lens of improvisation: the act of spontaneous composition. The more one tries to analyze the differences between the two approaches, the similarities reveal themselves much more than the differences. Join us for a kaleidoscope of musical excerpts and conversation as we delve into music in the moment.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMusicians include : Whitney George, Daniel Carter, Dan Kurfirst, &amp; John Murchison\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGeorge holds an undergraduate degree from the California Institute of the Arts, a masters degree from Brooklyn College Conservatory, and is currently continuing her studies as a PhD candidate at the CUNY Grad Center. In addition to her composing and conducting, George teaches at Brooklyn College, works at the Hitchcock Institute of American Studies and is the Managing Director for New York's AME.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe presenting beer sponsor is Sixpoint Brewery.\r\n</p>\r\n</div>",

In the greatest equalizing space of the city, Matthew \"Levee\" Chavez provided an outlet for the people in the form of post-it notes, sharpies, and an enormous amount of wall space.

But in recent decades, the long reach of real estate moguls has jeopardized the livelihood of small businesses and neighborhoods. Newsstands are being forcibly closed, with owners powerless to do anything. Family owned restaurants and shops are being strong-armed by building owners with exorbitant rent hikes. Families who have lived on blocks for generations watch as their neighborhoods undergo a cultural metamorphosis due to gentrification. For a decade, the owner of the blog Jeremiah's Vanishing New York has taken it upon himself to chronicle the sad and gradual disappearance of the landmarks that represent the identity of the city. Propelled by Moss\u2019 hard-hitting, cantankerous style, <em>Vanishing New York</em> is a staggering examination of contemporary \"urban renewal\" and its repercussions.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJoin us in the Rare Book Room as Jeremiah Moss discusses the slow death of old New York City and his new book with Amy Rose Spiegel.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAmy Rose Spiegel is a writer and editor based in New York City, the love of her life.

As a person who lets reason and science guide their worldview, she works for Caros, the top scientist in Night Vale.

During the investigation, she crosses paths with a group known as the Joyous Congregation of the Smiling God, and meets Darryl, one of its most committed members. Caught between her beliefs in the ultimate power of science and her growing attraction to Darryl, she begins to suspect the Congregation is plotting something that could threaten the lives of everyone in town.

In other words, human rights are not self-evident and inalienable. And human dignity can hardly be considered inherent when we so clearly continue to violate it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPart of the problem is that we don\u2019t have a clear idea of how human rights exist. Our current concept of human rights has evolved from out of an outdated metaphysics that has no bearing on the actual of work of advocacy groups and NGOs on the ground.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn this Olio we explore how Buddhism can help us arrive at a more philosophically robust concept of human rights that entails more than just theory, but also a set of introspective tools for realizing a human rights culture. In our analysis we'll also consider new psychedelic research that I believe may also contribute to this goal.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tChristopher Kelley holds a doctorate in Buddhist Studies from Columbia University, where he studied under the guidance of Professor Robert Thurman.

They offer a window into our personal and cultural attitudes about love, lust, and commitment. Infidelity is considered one of the most traumatic events that can befall a couple, yet this all too common experience is poorly understood. \u00a0Using real-life stories pulled from couples visiting her therapy practice over the past decade, Esther implores her readers to engage in a new conversation about the topic, in the hope of gaining a better understanding of the meaning of trust and fidelity.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAccording to Esther, affairs can have many meanings and many outcomes. While for some couples an affair can rob them of \u00a0their relationship and even their sense of identity, for others it can act as a powerful alarm system, shaking them out of complacency to save their relationship and strengthen their marriage.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIf you've ever wondered why infidelity is universally forbidden yet universally practiced, why even people in happy marriages cheat, or if it's even possible to affair-proof a marriage -- Esther is ready to join you in the Rare Book Room to discuss these questions and more.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJoin us in the Rare Book Room as Perel discusses these questions and more!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPsychotherapist Esther Perel is recognized as one of today\u2019s most insightful and original voices on modern relationships. Fluent in nine languages, she holds a therapy practice in New York City and serves as an organizational consultant for Fortune 500 companies around the world. Her celebrated TED talks have garnered more than 18 million views and her bestseller Mating in Captivity: Unlocking Erotic Intelligence became a global phenomenon translated into 24 languages. Her second book The State of Affairs: Rethinking Infidelity (HarperCollins) is due out October 2017. Esther is also an executive producer and the host of the Audible original series Where Should We Begin?\r\n</p>\r\n</div>",

Young women are combating entrenched sexism while celebrating their own sexual experience more freely than ever before. Young men continue to become \"woke\" and treat women with the respect they deserve, while other men continue to perpetuate the mire of misogyny. In these concentrated areas of rapid change, confusion and miscommunication are both rampant concerning the issue of sex on campus. \u00a0\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tVanessa Grigoriadis is working to clear up the confusion by going to schools large and small, immersing herself in their social world, and speaking candidly with dozens of students \u2013 among them, both accusers and accused-- as well as faculty, parents, and researchers. Her groundbreaking investigation reveals a number of modern truths about college life. She reveals the times and settings most dangerous for women (beware the \u201cred zone\u201d); she demystifies the slew of conflicting statistics concerning campus rape; she makes a strong case that not all \u201csexual assault\u201d should legally be considered assault; and she offers compelling, if controversial, advice on how schools, students, and parents can make college a safer, richer experience for everyone. The culmination of her engaging, fly-on-the-wall reportage is a revolutionary chronicle of how the rules of sex and power are being re-written, starting on college campuses.\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 12px;\">\r\n\t<img align=\"left\" alt=\"\" height=\"44\" hspace=\"5\" src=\"/resources/strand/images/uploads/admit-one-icon-44px.jpg\" style=\"line-height: 19.2px;\" vspace=\"3\" width=\"44\">\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 12px;\">\r\n\tBuy a copy of\u00a0<i>Blurred Lines\u00a0</i>or a $5 gift card in-store at the Strand's main floor registers or at the door to attend.

Photographed at a golden modernist structure on the edge of Joshua Tree National Park, architectural lines, light reflections and a single figure have been carefully balanced against the backdrop of the Californian desert.</span>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe human figure in these images--Kuhn\u2019s friend and collaborator Jacintha--emerges like a surrealist mirage, fragmented and indistinct, at times submerged in shadows or overexposed. The building\u2019s facades of glass and mirrors serve as optical planes, an extension of the artist\u2019s camera and lens. Light is split into refracting colors, desert vegetation grows sideways, inside is outside and outside in. Kuhn pushes a certain disorienting effect by introducing metallic foils as an additional surface, at times producing purely abstract results. <i>She Disappeared in Complete Silence</i>\u00a0marks Kuhn\u2019s increasing use of techniques that appear to merge the figure, abstraction and landscape into one.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJoin us in the Rare Book Room for a signing with Mona Kuhn!

In some ways it was a failed experiment: Papageorge mostly approached color in the same way as he approached black and white, except that he also began to intuitively produce still-life pictures with little commercial appeal, spotlighting canned hams in shop windows and political posters. But color offered Papageorge the opportunity to work in a new medium at a time of great social, political and cultural change. \"I\u2019d like to think that, in Dr. Blankman\u00b4s New York, you\u2019ll find a persuasive account of what it meant for me to be free with a Leica in the streets of my newly adopted home of Manhattan,\" writes Papageorge, \"a record drawn with Kodachrome film and its rich, saturated colors.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJoin us in the Rare Book Room as Tod Papageorge signs his new book!\r\n</p>\r\n</div>",

Wessel records the determination, impatience and blank boredom of his fellow drivers as they navigate a daily drill that seems at times daunting and hopeless. <em>Sunset Park</em> is Wessel\u2019s series of night photos of the modest working-class neighborhood of Sunset Park in Santa Monica. Wessel\u2019s final series, <em>Continental Divide</em>, takes the viewer on a ride from the dense, suburban flatlands of the Midwest, up across the Rocky Mountains, and down into the sparse desert landscape of the American West. Wessel depicts its houses, shacks, street corners and the highway, reminding us of the inherent aesthetics of the everyday.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Join us in the Rare Book Room for a signing opportunity with Henry Wessel!</span>\r\n</p>\r\n</div>",

Through hard work and perseverance he has risen to an unequivocal level of success having started his work in the entertainment industry with a play that garnered almost no ticket-sales. This didn\u2019t deter Perry, instead pushing him on to work harder and try again and the next time he put on his play he was met with sold-out crowds. Now he\u2019s ready to pass on the things he has learned in life in his spiritual guide Higher is Waiting.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn this book, Tyler shares how his faith in God is what has carried him through all of the tough times he\u2019s experienced, from a difficult upbringing to failed career endeavors. He tells about the people in his life and the lessons they taught him, lessons about integrity, forgiveness, and trust in God. Perry describes how he has grown into the devoted son, the loving father, the creative spirit, and more after growing aware of God\u2019s presence in his life.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<span style=\"color: rgb(29, 33, 41); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Join us as Tyler Perry sits down with TV host Michael Strahan and shares his work!</span>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Please Note: </strong>Each ticket comes with one copy of <em>Higher is Waiting</em>.\u00a0Purchase a ticket through <a href=\"https://concerts1.livenation.com/event/0000536624A47665\">Live Nation's website to attend</a>.

This volume brings together for the first time a selection of sixty of the most influential and seminal interviews with artists ranging from Richard Serra and Brice Marden, to Alex Da Corte and House of Ladosha. While each interview is important in its own right, offering a perspective on the life and work of a specific artist, collectively they tell the story of a journal that has grown during one of the more diverse and surprising periods in visual art. There is no unified style or perspective; The Brooklyn Rail\u2019s strength lies in its ability to include and champion difference.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSelected and coedited by Jarrett Earnest, a frequent Rail contributor, with Lucas Zwirner, the book includes an introduction to the project by Phong Bui as well as many of the hand-drawn portraits he has made of those he has interviewed over the years. This combination of verbal and visual profiles offers a rare and personal insight into contemporary visual culture.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJoin us in the Rare Book Room for a panel discussion featuring Brooklyn Rail publisher Phong Bui along with Jonas Mekas, Shirin Neshat, Shahzia Sikander and Jack Whitten, who are included in the book, moderated by Lucas Zwirner!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t-\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<img alt=\"\" height=\"381\" src=\"/resources/strand/images/uploads/mekas-web1.jpg\" width=\"296\">\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJonas Mekas was born in Semeni\u0161kiai, Lithuania and has lived and worked in New York City since 1949.

Vern Barclay, a reclusive radio host/ fugitive from the law hosts the local radio program \"Radio Free Vemont\". In response to Vern's rhetoric, McKibben imagines an eccentric group of activists who carry out their own version of guerilla warfare, which includes dismissing local middle school children early in honor of 'Ethan Allen Day' and hijacking a Coors Light truck and replacing the stock with local brew. Witty, biting, and terrifyingly timely, <em>Radio Free Vermont</em> is Bill McKibben's fictional response to a burgeoning movement.\u00a0\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJoin us in the 2nd floor art department as Bill McKibben discusses his latest book!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<img alt=\"\" height=\"300\" src=\"/resources/strand/images/uploads/mckibben_bill_creditNancieBattaglia.jpg\" width=\"450\">\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBill McKibben is an author and environmentalist. His 1989 book <em>The End of Nature </em>is regarded as the first book for a general audience about climate change, and has appeared in 24 languages; he's gone on to write a dozen more books, including <em>Eaarth</em> and <em>Oil and Honey</em>. He is a founder of 350.org, the first planet-wide, grassroots climate change movement, which launched the fast-growing fossil fuel divestment movement. He lives in Vermont.\r\n</p>\r\n</div>",

Every person he passed on the street was an actor; everything he saw was part of a synchronized script to help inspire Zack to give a performance of a lifetime. After a manic spree around Manhattan, Zack was arrested on a subway platform and sent to Bellevue Hospital.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis was the start of Zack's fall into psychosis and his desperate, macabre struggle to claw his way back to sanity, an adventure that led him to be tackled by guards in mental wards, streaking through cornfields, receiving secret messages from the TV, and more. It's a journey that will take him across the country, back to his Kansas roots and to the one person who might be able to save him: his tough, big-hearted Midwestern mother, nicknamed 'the Bird'.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t-\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen Jaime Lowe was sixteen-years-old she stopped sleeping, stopped eating, and began to hallucinate\u2014demonically cackling Muppets, faces lurking in windows, Michael Jackson delivering messages from the Neverland Underground. She wrote manifestos and math equations in her diary, and drew infographics on her bedroom wall. She ended up hospitalized and diagnosed as bipolar, and was prescribed lithium.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn her memoir Jaime shares her story of episodic madness, as well as the stability she found when taking lithium. She interviews scientists, psychiatrists, and patients to examine how effective lithium really is, where it comes from, and how its side effects can be dangerous for long-term users\u2014including herself, who after twenty years on the medication suffers from severe kidney damage. With unflinching honesty and humor, Jaime allows a clear-eyed view into her life, and an arresting inquiry into one of mankind\u2019s oldest medical mysteries\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJoin us in Strand's secret 10th floor room as Zack and Jaime share their stories and sign copies of their books.\u00a0<span style=\"color: rgb(29, 33, 41); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Take the elevator in 826 Broadway to the 10th floor.</span>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis event is presented in partnership with\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.fountainhouse.org/\">Fountain House</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t-\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Zack McDermott</strong> has worked as a public defender for the Legal Aid Society of New York.

Copies will be available at the event, which will take place in the Photography section on the Strand's second floor, accessible by the main store stairs or elevator at 828 Broadway (at 12th Street).\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn 1964, while on assignment for Newsweek magazine, photojournalist Elliott Erwitt spent a week in Cuba as a guest of Fidel Castro. There, he captured now-iconic photographs of the beloved Cuban president along with the revolutionary leader Che Guevara. Over fifty years later, coinciding with restored diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States, Erwitt returned to document both its urban and rural landscapes, and -most prominently- the people of this fascinating nation. Presented in a book for the very first time, Erwitt's captivating black-and-white photographs offer an intimate look into this intriguing Caribbean island. From candid glimpses of Fidel Castro to Havana's breathtaking architectural details and scenes of rural life, Cuba reflects an in-depth visual exploration that unveils the heart and soul of the country. Complete with anecdotal recollections penned by Erwitt himself (for example, the time when Che Guevara offered him a box of cigars) and a compelling foreword written by Henry Louis Gates, Jr., this stunning tome isn't a mere chronicling of Cuba's people and places--it's a historical record of a nation in flux as it opens up to the rest of the world.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJoin us on the second floor Art Department as Elliott Erwitt signs copies of <em>Cuba</em>!\r\n</p>\r\n</div>",

With authors and advocates requesting hard-earned respect and recognition these works beg the question: what part does respect play in these stories? And why is it so many readers seem to enjoy seeing women portrayed as victims?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJoin us in the Rare Book Room as a panel of distinguished and esteemed romance writers discuss respect in their beloved genre.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFeaturing:\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Loretta Chase</li>\r\n\t<li>Joanna Shupe</li>\r\n\t<li>Tessa Bailey</li>\r\n\t<li>Megan Frampton</li>\r\n\t<li>Tracey Livesay</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\tModerating the panel is Denny S. Bryce!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t-\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLoretta Chase has worked in academia, retail, and the visual arts, as well as on the streets as a meter maid, and in video, as a scriptwriter. She might have developed an excitingly checkered career had her spouse not nagged her into writing fiction. Her bestselling historical romances, set in the Regency and Romantic eras of the early 19th century, have won a number of awards, including the Romance Writers of America\u2019s Rita Award. For more about her past, her books, and what she does and doesn\u2019t do on social media, please visit her website www.LorettaChase.com.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJoanna Shupe has always loved history, ever since she watched her first Schoolhouse Rock cartoon. While in college, Joanna read every romance she could get her hands on, and soon started crafting her own racy historical novels. In 2013, she won Romance Writers of America's prestigious Golden Heart Award for Best Historical Romance. She now lives in New Jersey with her two spirited daughters and dashing husband. To connect with Joanna, visit JoannaShupe.com.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTessa Bailey is originally from Carlsbad, California. The day after high school graduation, she packed her yearbook, ripped jeans, and laptop, and drove cross-country to New York City in under four days. Her most valuable life experiences were learned thereafter while waitressing at K-Dees, a Manhattan pub owned by her uncle. Inside those four walls, she met her husband, best friend, and discovered the magic of classic rock, managing to put herself through Kingsborough Community College and the English program at Pace University at the same time. Several stunted attempts to enter the work force as a journalist followed, but romance writing continued to demand her attention. She now lives in Long Island, New York with her husband and daughter. Although she is severely sleep-deprived, she is incredibly happy to be living her dream of writing about people falling in love.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMegan Frampton writes historical romance under her own name and romantic women's fiction under the name Megan Caldwell.

You can visit her website at www.meganframpton.com. She tweets as @meganf and is at Facebook.com/meganframptonbooks.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tA former criminal defense attorney, Tracey Livesay finds crafting believable \"happily ever afters\" slightly more challenging than protecting our constitutional rights, but she's never regretted following her heart instead of her law degree. She has been featured in Entertainment Weekly, the Washington Post, and CBS This Morning. Tracey lives in Virginia with her husband-who she met on the very first day of law school-- and their three children.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDenny S.

This event will take place in the Art Department on the Strand's 2ndd floor, accessible via the main store stairs or elevator.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the 1980s politics experienced a shift, deciding to step-up efforts and started to crack-down on crime; however well-intended the idea may have been, there wasn\u2019t enough preparation which led to several problems including overcrowded state prisons. This problem led to private companies coming up with a profitable solution: build and operate correctional facilities. Today more than 100,000 of the 1.5 million incarcerated Americans are held in these private prisons, structures which garner much-deserved criticism for their sole focus of profit - $5 billion in profit. And that is where heavy-hitter Lauren-Brooke Eisen steps into the scene.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tA prosecutor, journalist, and attorney at policy think-tanks, Eisen is no stranger to these companies, having done extensive investigative reportage and quantitative and historical research in order to analyze privatized corrections in the United States. She\u2019s examined every facet of the issue, from divestment campaigns to boardrooms to private immigration-detention centers and spoken with inmates, their families, correctional staff, policymakers, activists, Immigration and Customs Enforcement employees, undocumented immigrants, and the executives of America\u2019s largest private prison corporations.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThese private prisons have become the source of the anti-mass-incarceration movement; universities, political candidates, and the Department of Justice have all been to remove their connections with these companies. At the same time, impoverished rural town often try to garner these for-profit prison industry types to have them build facilities in order to create new jobs. With this in mind, Eisen has sifted through the complicated and recalcitrant incentives in the industry in order to build a guide for policymakers as a call for reform.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJoin us in our 2nd Floor Art Department as Eisen shares her research with <em>Slate</em> staff writer Leon Neyfakh in an in-depth discussion.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t-\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLauren-Brooke Eisen is senior counsel in the Brennan Center\u2019s Justice Program, where she focuses on changing financial incentives in the criminal-justice system. Previously she was a senior program associate at the Vera Institute of Justice in the Center on Sentencing and Corrections, served as an assistant district attorney in New York City, and taught criminal justice at Yale College and the John Jay College of Criminal Justice.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLeon Neyfakh is a staff writer at <em>Slate</em>, where he covers criminal justice in general and the Justice Department in particular. He previously worked at the Boston Globe as a reporter for the Ideas section.

He has created a dedicated school for those wishing to master the written word, this being after he founded NYU's graduate writing program.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCelebrate the release of poet and The Writers Studio Founder Philip Schultz\u2019s new collection of poetry, <em>Luxury</em>. Pulitzer Prize winning poet, Philip Schultz will read selections from his new volume and discuss his work with poet, editor, novelist and essayist, Jill Bialosky.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSchultz\u2019s new collection, Luxury, has invoked a wry voice which exhibits both existential philosophies and modern issues. Luxury takes its name from the featured poem, which is a call-back to Schultz\u2019s Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning collection <em>Failure</em>. The poem is a beautiful exploration of the pull toward life as Schultz examines the question of suicide, intimately probing a familial pull toward that darkness and weaving in the philosophy of various famous authors. Using humor, irony, and celebration as ballast against the book\u2019s darker forces, Luxury explores the comfort and sustenance of life, the bittersweet clarity of aging, and the anxiety of existence.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<img alt=\"\" height=\"302\" src=\"/resources/strand/images/uploads/Schultz,%20Philip%20(c)%20Monica%20Banks.jpg\" width=\"300\">\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPhilip Schultz is a poet, and the founder/director of The Writers Studio, a private school for fiction and poetry writing based in New York City.

In 1917 Picasso fell in love with a ballerina in the Ballets Russes while creating scenery and costumes for his collaboration with Satie on the pathbreaking dance work, Parade. His stage designs changed the course of his painting. Alexander Calder, who has a major show at the Whitney this summer, created his famous Circus as well as the set for Satie's opera Socrate and many other theater works.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCultural historian Charles A. Riley II, author of Free as Gods, will share the backstage secrets of Picasso, Calder, Leger, Chagall, Hockney, Kentridge, and many other contemporary artists who have found a home in the theater.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCharles Riley II, PhD, is an arts journalist, curator and professor at Clarkson University. He is the author of thirty-two books on art, architecture and public policy. Upcoming books include Free as Gods (University Press of New England) and Rodin and his Circle (Chimei Museum, Taiwan).\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAfter Professor Riley's Olio, members from the company of <em>The Other Side of Paradise</em> invite you to listen to select songs from the musical. <em>The Other Side of Paradise</em> is a wild concert telling of the relationship between Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald, written by Angela Sclafani. Part concert, part theater, part 1920's underground apartment party, the night spans 40 years of history in one blazing 75 minute set. After selling out their world premiere at Ars Nova's ANT Fest, the jazz concert party has announced a speakeasy club tour in July.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe presenting beer sponsor is Sixpoint Brewery.

In March, Vice President Pence cast a tie-breaking vote on a controversial bill that moved Congress one step closer to defunding clinics that offer abortion services. Women\u2019s rights organizations are furious. Articles and op-eds are everywhere. The Pro-Choice movement is predicting Roe v Wade will soon come under reexamination by the Supreme Court. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis lecture will bring listeners up to speed on the legal history of reproductive rights in America beyond Roe v Wade. Topics will include the origins of Planned Parenthood, the abortion debates of the twentieth-century, the early birth-control movement, the role of the Supreme Court on this issue and, most especially, the fact that reproductive rights are legally rooted in the constitutional right to privacy. Front and center will be a retelling of the three most important reproductive rights cases in US legal history \u2013 including Roe. Listeners are invited to move beyond the typical knee-jerk reactions that so often accompany this emotionally charged issue, and gain a better grasp of exactly how reproductive rights are positioned and protected in our laws. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLawrence Cappello is an historian and privacy advocate. He is the director of quantitative research at the CUNY Center of Latino Studies and a lecturer of United States history at CUNY Queens College.

They questioned who sex shops benefited, what type of customer visited them, what potential could they acheive, and through their brainstorming and research created companies such as Eve\u2019s Garden, Good Vibrations, and Babeland. These weren't mere commercial enterprises, but places of education and providers of community resources. They changed how sex was discussed, how it was had, and even how it was enjoyed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn <em>Vibrator Nation</em> Lynn Comella shares how these sex-positive retailers raised sexual consciousness and doubled as social activists, having redefined the adult industry and changed the lives of women everywhere.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJoin us in the Rare Book Room as Lynn Comella sits down with Julie Scelfo, author of Women Who Made New York, to discuss this all important industry and outlook.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPresented in partnership with Babeland and with NYU's Center for Study of Gender and Sexuality.\r\n</p>\r\n</div>",

Stunned, confused, and only twenty-nine years old, Hinton knew that it was a case of mistaken identity and believed that the truth would prove his innocence and ultimately set him free.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut with no money and a different system of justice for a poor black man in the South, Hinton was sentenced to death by electrocution. He spent his first three years on Death Row at Holman State Prison in agonizing silence?full of despair and anger toward all those who had sent an innocent man to his death. But as Hinton realized and accepted his fate, he resolved not only to survive, but find a way to live on Death Row. For the next twenty-seven years he was a beacon?transforming not only his own spirit, but those of his fellow inmates, fifty-four of whom were executed mere feet from his cell. With the help of civil rights attorney and bestselling author of Just Mercy, Bryan Stevenson, Hinton won his release in 2015.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWith a foreword by Stevenson, The Sun Does Shine is an extraordinary testament to the power of hope sustained through the darkest times. Destined to be a classic memoir of wrongful imprisonment and freedom won, Hinton\u2019s memoir tells his dramatic thirty-year journey and shows how you can take away a man\u2019s freedom, but you can\u2019t take away his imagination, humor, or joy.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJoin us in the Rare Book Room as Anthony Ray Hinton shares his experience and launches his autobiography.\r\n</p>\r\n</div>",

	"description": "<div class=\"event__description\"><p>\r\n\tThe Buddha is believed to have taught that the fundamental nature of the human condition is suffused with feelings of existential angst and abiding dissatisfaction. Such realism is not exclusive to Buddhism, however. As any dark comedian knows this already because making jokes about the reality of life usually gets big laughs, or as they say in the business\u2014\u201ckills.\u201d Like the Buddha, the comic can be a powerful medium for communicating the more disquieting and shunned truths in life. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJoin me in a provocative conversation on the merits of dark comedy as a vehicle for embracing the truth of the human condition. We\u2019ll watch video clips of comedians like Louis C.K., Tig Notaro, and Andy Kaufman. And we\u2019ll discuss why I believe that both Buddhism and dark comedy offer a kind of therapy for eliminating the existential anxiety that comes from being the kind of animal that lives with the knowledge of their own inexorable death. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tChristopher Kelley holds a doctorate in Buddhist Studies from Columbia University, where he studied under the guidance of Professor Robert Thurman. He currently teaches at Brooklyn College (CUNY) and the New School University in the City of New York. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe presenting beer sponsor is Sixpoint Brewery.
