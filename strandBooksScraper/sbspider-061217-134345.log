There, he captured now-iconic photographs of the beloved Cuban president along with the revolutionary leader Che Guevara. Over fifty years later, coinciding with restored diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States, Erwitt returned to document both its urban and rural landscapes, and -most prominently- the people of this fascinating nation. Presented in a book for the very first time, Erwitt\'s captivating black-and-white photographs offer an intimate look into this intriguing Caribbean island. From candid glimpses of Fidel Castro to Havana\'s breathtaking architectural details and scenes of rural life, Cuba reflects an in-depth visual exploration that unveils the heart and soul of the country. Complete with anecdotal recollections penned by Erwitt himself (for example, the time when Che Guevara offered him a box of cigars) and a compelling foreword written by Henry Louis Gates, Jr., this stunning tome isn\'t a mere chronicling of Cuba\'s people and places--it\'s a historical record of a nation in flux as it opens up to the rest of the world.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJoin us on the second floor Art Department as Elliott Erwitt signs copies of <em>Cuba</em>!\r\n</p>\r\n</div>', 'EventTitle': ' Elliott Erwitt Signs CUBA', 'Address': '', 'EndTime': '8:30PM'}

Every person he passed on the street was an actor; everything he saw was part of a synchronized script to help inspire Zack to give a performance of a lifetime. After a manic spree around Manhattan, Zack was arrested on a subway platform and sent to Bellevue Hospital.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis was the start of Zack\'s fall into psychosis and his desperate, macabre struggle to claw his way back to sanity, an adventure that led him to be tackled by guards in mental wards, streaking through cornfields, receiving secret messages from the TV, and more. It\'s a journey that will take him across the country, back to his Kansas roots and to the one person who might be able to save him: his tough, big-hearted Midwestern mother, nicknamed \'the Bird\'.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t-\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen Jaime Lowe was sixteen-years-old she stopped sleeping, stopped eating, and began to hallucinate—demonically cackling Muppets, faces lurking in windows, Michael Jackson delivering messages from the Neverland Underground. She wrote manifestos and math equations in her diary, and drew infographics on her bedroom wall. She ended up hospitalized and diagnosed as bipolar, and was prescribed lithium.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn her memoir Jaime shares her story of episodic madness, as well as the stability she found when taking lithium. She interviews scientists, psychiatrists, and patients to examine how effective lithium really is, where it comes from, and how its side effects can be dangerous for long-term users—including herself, who after twenty years on the medication suffers from severe kidney damage. With unflinching honesty and humor, Jaime allows a clear-eyed view into her life, and an arresting inquiry into one of mankind’s oldest medical mysteries\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJoin us in Strand\'s secret 10th floor room as Zack and Jaime share their stories and sign copies of their books.\xa0<span style="color: rgb(29, 33, 41); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">Take the elevator in 826 Broadway to the 10th floor.</span>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis event is presented in partnership with\xa0<a href="https://www.fountainhouse.org/">Fountain House</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t-\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Zack McDermott</strong> has worked as a public defender for the Legal Aid Society of New York.

With authors and advocates requesting hard-earned respect and recognition these works beg the question: what part does respect play in these stories? And why is it so many readers seem to enjoy seeing women portrayed as victims?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJoin us in the Rare Book Room as a panel of distinguished and esteemed romance writers discuss respect in their beloved genre.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFeaturing:\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Loretta Chase</li>\r\n\t<li>Joanna Shupe</li>\r\n\t<li>Tessa Bailey</li>\r\n\t<li>Megan Frampton</li>\r\n\t<li>Tracey Livesay</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\tModerating the panel is Denny S. Bryce!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t-\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLoretta Chase has worked in academia, retail, and the visual arts, as well as on the streets as a meter maid, and in video, as a scriptwriter. She might have developed an excitingly checkered career had her spouse not nagged her into writing fiction. Her bestselling historical romances, set in the Regency and Romantic eras of the early 19th century, have won a number of awards, including the Romance Writers of America’s Rita Award. For more about her past, her books, and what she does and doesn’t do on social media, please visit her website www.LorettaChase.com.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJoanna Shupe has always loved history, ever since she watched her first Schoolhouse Rock cartoon. While in college, Joanna read every romance she could get her hands on, and soon started crafting her own racy historical novels. In 2013, she won Romance Writers of America\'s prestigious Golden Heart Award for Best Historical Romance. She now lives in New Jersey with her two spirited daughters and dashing husband. To connect with Joanna, visit JoannaShupe.com.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTessa Bailey is originally from Carlsbad, California. The day after high school graduation, she packed her yearbook, ripped jeans, and laptop, and drove cross-country to New York City in under four days. Her most valuable life experiences were learned thereafter while waitressing at K-Dees, a Manhattan pub owned by her uncle. Inside those four walls, she met her husband, best friend, and discovered the magic of classic rock, managing to put herself through Kingsborough Community College and the English program at Pace University at the same time. Several stunted attempts to enter the work force as a journalist followed, but romance writing continued to demand her attention. She now lives in Long Island, New York with her husband and daughter. Although she is severely sleep-deprived, she is incredibly happy to be living her dream of writing about people falling in love.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMegan Frampton writes historical romance under her own name and romantic women\'s fiction under the name Megan Caldwell. She likes the color black, gin, dark-haired British men, and huge earrings, not in that order. She lives in Brooklyn, New York, with her husband and son. You can visit her website at www.meganframpton.com. She tweets as @meganf and is at Facebook.com/meganframptonbooks.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tA former criminal defense attorney, Tracey Livesay finds crafting believable "happily ever afters" slightly more challenging than protecting our constitutional rights, but she\'s never regretted following her heart instead of her law degree. She has been featured in Entertainment Weekly, the Washington Post, and CBS This Morning. Tracey lives in Virginia with her husband-who she met on the very first day of law school-- and their three children.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDenny S. Bryce is a two-time RWA Golden Heart finalist, who won the Golden Heart in 2014 for Chasing Damn, a romantic suspense. An aspiring author, she writes historical fiction, romantic suspense, and contemporary romance. She also is a regular contributor to the Happy Ever After USA Today blog where she writes about fan fiction, author book boyfriends/book girlfriends, and recaps Outlander on STARZ. Based in Virginia, she is represented by Nalini Akolekar at Spencerhill Associates.\r\n</p>\r\n</div>', 'EventTitle': 'Romance and Respect', 'Address': '', 'EndTime': '8:00PM'}

Pulitzer Prize winning poet, Philip Schultz will read selections from his new volume and discuss his work with poet, editor, novelist and essayist, Jill Bialosky.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSchultz’s new collection, Luxury, has invoked a wry voice which exhibits both existential philosophies and modern issues. Luxury takes its name from the featured poem, which is a call-back to Schultz’s Pulitzer Prize–winning collection <em>Failure</em>. The poem is a beautiful exploration of the pull toward life as Schultz examines the question of suicide, intimately probing a familial pull toward that darkness and weaving in the philosophy of various famous authors. Using humor, irony, and celebration as ballast against the book’s darker forces, Luxury explores the comfort and sustenance of life, the bittersweet clarity of aging, and the anxiety of existence.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<img alt="" height="302" src="/resources/strand/images/uploads/Schultz,%20Philip%20(c)%20Monica%20Banks.jpg" width="300">\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPhilip Schultz is a poet, and the founder/director of The Writers Studio, a private school for fiction and poetry writing based in New York City.

Stunned, confused, and only twenty-nine years old, Hinton knew that it was a case of mistaken identity and believed that the truth would prove his innocence and ultimately set him free.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut with no money and a different system of justice for a poor black man in the South, Hinton was sentenced to death by electrocution. He spent his first three years on Death Row at Holman State Prison in agonizing silence?full of despair and anger toward all those who had sent an innocent man to his death. But as Hinton realized and accepted his fate, he resolved not only to survive, but find a way to live on Death Row. For the next twenty-seven years he was a beacon?transforming not only his own spirit, but those of his fellow inmates, fifty-four of whom were executed mere feet from his cell. With the help of civil rights attorney and bestselling author of Just Mercy, Bryan Stevenson, Hinton won his release in 2015.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWith a foreword by Stevenson, The Sun Does Shine is an extraordinary testament to the power of hope sustained through the darkest times. Destined to be a classic memoir of wrongful imprisonment and freedom won, Hinton’s memoir tells his dramatic thirty-year journey and shows how you can take away a man’s freedom, but you can’t take away his imagination, humor, or joy.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJoin us in the Rare Book Room as Anthony Ray Hinton shares his experience and launches his autobiography.\r\n</p>\r\n</div>', 'EventTitle': 'Anthony Ray Hinton: The Sun Does Shine', 'Address': '', 'EndTime': '8:00PM'}
